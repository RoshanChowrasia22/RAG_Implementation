However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of\\nthe same ﬁeld, and together they have undergone substantial development over the\\npast ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to\\nbecome mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework\\nfor describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of\\nBayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of\\napproximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa-\\ngation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had signiﬁcant impact on both\\nalgorithms and applications.\\nThis new textbook reﬂects these recent developments while providing a compre-\\nhensive introduction to the ﬁelds of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is\\naimed at advanced undergraduates or ﬁrst year PhD students, as well as researchers\\nand practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma-\\nchine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra\\nis required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es-\\nsential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.\\nBecause this book has broad scope, it is impossible to provide a complete list of\\nreferences, and in particular no attempt has been made to provide accurate historical\\nattribution of ideas. Instead, the aim has been to give references that offer greater\\ndetail than is possible here and that hopefully provide entry points into what, in some\\ncases, is a very extensive literature. For this reason, the references are often to more\\nrecent textbooks and review articles rather than to original sources.\\nThe book is supported by a great deal of additional material, including lecture\\nslides as well as the complete set of ﬁgures used in the book, and the reader is\\nencouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information:\\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/∼cmbishop/PRML\\nvii'),\n",

Each exercise has been carefully chosen to reinforce concepts\\nexplained in the text or to develop and generalize them in signiﬁcant ways, and each\\nis graded according to difﬁculty ranging from (⋆), which denotes a simple exercise\\ntaking a few minutes to complete, through to (⋆⋆⋆), which denotes a signiﬁcantly\\nmore complex exercise.\\nIt has been difﬁcult to know to what extent these solutions should be made\\nwidely available. Those engaged in self study will ﬁnd worked solutions very ben-\\neﬁcial, whereas many course tutors request that solutions be available only via the\\npublisher so that the exercises may be used in class. In order to try to meet these\\nconﬂicting requirements, those exercises that help amplify key points in the text, or\\nthat ﬁll in important details, have solutions that are available as a PDF ﬁle from the\\nbook web site. Such exercises are denoted by www . Solutions for the remaining\\nexercises are available to course tutors by contacting the publisher (contact details\\nare given on the book web site). Readers are strongly encouraged to work through\\nthe exercises unaided, and to turn to the solutions only as required.\\nAlthough this book focuses on concepts and principles, in a taught course the\\nstudents should ideally have the opportunity to experiment with some of the key\\nalgorithms using appropriate data sets. A companion volume (Bishop and Nabney,\\n2008) will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning,\\nand will be accompanied by Matlab software implementing most of the algorithms\\ndiscussed in this book.\\nAcknowledgements\\nFirst of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Markus Svens´en who\\nhas provided immense help with preparation of ﬁgures and with the typesetting of\\nthe book in LATEX. His assistance has been invaluable.\\nI am very grateful to Microsoft Research for providing a highly stimulating re-\\nsearch environment and for giving me the freedom to write this book (the views and\\nopinions expressed in this book, however, are my own and are therefore not neces-\\nsarily the same as those of Microsoft or its afﬁliates).\\nSpringer has provided excellent support throughout the ﬁnal stages of prepara-\\ntion of this book, and I would like to thank my commissioning editor John Kimmel\\nfor his support and professionalism, as well as Joseph Piliero for his help in design-\\ning the cover and the text format and MaryAnn Brickner for her numerous contribu-\\ntions during the production phase. The inspiration for the cover design came from a\\ndiscussion with Antonio Criminisi.\\nI also wish to thank Oxford University Press for permission to reproduce ex-\\ncerpts from an earlier textbook, Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Bishop,\\n1995a).

However, this minimum level is\\nnonzero, and it should be emphasized that a good grasp of calculus, linear algebra,\\nand probability theory is essential for a clear understanding of modern pattern recog-\\nnition and machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the emphasis in this book is\\non conveying the underlying concepts rather than on mathematical rigour.\\nI have tried to use a consistent notation throughout the book, although at times\\nthis means departing from some of the conventions used in the corresponding re-\\nsearch literature. Vectors are denoted by lower case bold Roman letters such as\\nx, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript T denotes the\\ntranspose of a matrix or vector, so that xT will be a row vector. Uppercase bold\\nroman letters, such as M, denote matrices. The notation (w1, . . . , wM) denotes a\\nrow vector with M elements, while the corresponding column vector is written as\\nw = (w1, . . . , wM)T.\\nThe notation [a, b] is used to denote the closed interval from a to b, that is the\\ninterval including the values a and b themselves, while (a, b) denotes the correspond-\\ning open interval, that is the interval excluding a and b. Similarly, [a, b) denotes an\\ninterval that includes a but excludes b. For the most part, however, there will be\\nlittle need to dwell on such reﬁnements as whether the end points of an interval are\\nincluded or not.\\nThe M × M identity matrix (also known as the unit matrix) is denoted IM,\\nwhich will be abbreviated to I where there is no ambiguity about it dimensionality.\\nIt has elements Iij that equal 1 if i = j and 0 if i ̸= j.\\nA functional is denoted f[y] where y(x) is some function. The concept of a\\nfunctional is discussed in Appendix D.\\nThe notation g(x) = O(f(x)) denotes that |f(x)/g(x)| is bounded as x →∞.\\nFor instance if g(x) = 3x2 + 2, then g(x) = O(x2).\\nThe expectation of a function f(x, y) with respect to a random variable x is de-\\nnoted by Ex[f(x, y)]. In situations where there is no ambiguity as to which variable\\nis being averaged over, this will be simpliﬁed by omitting the sufﬁx, for instance\\nxi'),\n",

If the distribution of x is conditioned on another variable z, then the corre-\\nsponding conditional expectation will be written Ex[f(x)|z]. Similarly, the variance\\nis denoted var[f(x)], and for vector variables the covariance is written cov[x, y]. We\\nshall also use cov[x] as a shorthand notation for cov[x, x]. The concepts of expecta-\\ntions and covariances are introduced in Section 1.2.2.\\nIf we have N values x1, . . . , xN of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T,\\nwe can combine the observations into a data matrix X in which the nth row of X\\ncorresponds to the row vector xT\\nn. Thus the n, i element of X corresponds to the\\nith element of the nth observation xn. For the case of one-dimensional variables we\\nshall denote such a matrix by x, which is a column vector whose nth element is xn.\\nNote that x (which has dimensionality N) uses a different typeface to distinguish it\\nfrom x (which has dimensionality D).'),\n",

For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho\\nBrahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of\\nplanetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of clas-\\nsical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a\\nkey role in the development and veriﬁcation of quantum physics in the early twenti-\\neth century. The ﬁeld of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discov-\\nery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of\\nthese regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.\\nConsider the example of recognizing handwritten digits, illustrated in Figure 1.1.\\nEach digit corresponds to a 28×28 pixel image and so can be represented by a vector\\nx comprising 784 real numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a\\nvector x as input and that will produce the identity of the digit 0, . . . , 9 as the output.\\nThis is a nontrivial problem due to the wide variability of handwriting.

INTRODUCTION\\nFigure 1.1\\nExamples of hand-written dig-\\nits taken from US zip codes.\\ntackled using handcrafted rules or heuristics for distinguishing the digits based on\\nthe shapes of the strokes, but in practice such an approach leads to a proliferation of\\nrules and of exceptions to the rules and so on, and invariably gives poor results.\\nFar better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in\\nwhich a large set of N digits {x1, . . . , xN} called a training set is used to tune the\\nparameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set\\nare known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling\\nthem. We can express the category of a digit using target vector t, which represents\\nthe identity of the corresponding digit. Suitable techniques for representing cate-\\ngories in terms of vectors will be discussed later. Note that there is one such target\\nvector t for each digit image x.\\nThe result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a\\nfunction y(x) which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output\\nvector y, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form of the\\nfunction y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the learning\\nphase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is trained it can then de-\\ntermine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a test set. The\\nability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for train-\\ning is known as generalization. In practical applications, the variability of the input\\nvectors will be such that the training data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all\\npossible input vectors, and so generalization is a central goal in pattern recognition.\\nFor most practical applications, the original input variables are typically prepro-\\ncessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the\\npattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. For instance, in the digit recogni-\\ntion problem, the images of the digits are typically translated and scaled so that each\\ndigit is contained within a box of a ﬁxed size. This greatly reduces the variability\\nwithin each digit class, because the location and scale of all the digits are now the\\nsame, which makes it much easier for a subsequent pattern recognition algorithm\\nto distinguish between the different classes. This pre-processing stage is sometimes\\nalso called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed using\\nthe same steps as the training data.\\nPre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation. For\\nexample, if the goal is real-time face detection in a high-resolution video stream,\\nthe computer must handle huge numbers of pixels per second, and presenting these\\ndirectly to a complex pattern recognition algorithm may be computationally infeasi-\\nble. Instead, the aim is to ﬁnd useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that'),\n",

INTRODUCTION\\n3\\nalso preserve useful discriminatory information enabling faces to be distinguished\\nfrom non-faces. These features are then used as the inputs to the pattern recognition\\nalgorithm. For instance, the average value of the image intensity over a rectangular\\nsubregion can be evaluated extremely efﬁciently (Viola and Jones, 2004), and a set of\\nsuch features can prove very effective in fast face detection. Because the number of\\nsuch features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing repre-\\nsents a form of dimensionality reduction. Care must be taken during pre-processing\\nbecause often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the\\nsolution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer.\\nApplications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors\\nalong with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning prob-\\nlems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each\\ninput vector to one of a ﬁnite number of discrete categories, are called classiﬁcation\\nproblems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then\\nthe task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the pre-\\ndiction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist\\nof the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure.\\nIn other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input\\nvectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised\\nlearning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data,\\nwhere it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input\\nspace, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional\\nspace down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization.\\nFinally, the technique of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con-\\ncerned with the problem of ﬁnding suitable actions to take in a given situation in\\norder to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of\\noptimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them\\nby a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in\\nwhich the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the\\ncurrent action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the re-\\nward at all subsequent time steps. For example, by using appropriate reinforcement\\nlearning techniques a neural network can learn to play the game of backgammon to a\\nhigh standard (Tesauro, 1994). Here the network must learn to take a board position\\nas input, along with the result of a dice throw, and produce a strong move as the\\noutput. This is done by having the network play against a copy of itself for perhaps a\\nmillion games. A major challenge is that a game of backgammon can involve dozens\\nof moves, and yet it is only at the end of the game that the reward, in the form of\\nvictory, is achieved. The reward must then be attributed appropriately to all of the\\nmoves that led to it, even though some moves will have been good ones and others\\nless so. This is an example of a credit assignment problem.

One of the main\\ngoals of this chapter is to introduce, in a relatively informal way, several of the most\\nimportant of these concepts and to illustrate them using simple examples. Later in\\nthe book we shall see these same ideas re-emerge in the context of more sophisti-\\ncated models that are applicable to real-world pattern recognition applications. This\\nchapter also provides a self-contained introduction to three important tools that will\\nbe used throughout the book, namely probability theory, decision theory, and infor-\\nmation theory. Although these might sound like daunting topics, they are in fact\\nstraightforward, and a clear understanding of them is essential if machine learning\\ntechniques are to be used to best effect in practical applications.\\n1.1. Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting\\nWe begin by introducing a simple regression problem, which we shall use as a run-\\nning example throughout this chapter to motivate a number of key concepts. Sup-\\npose we observe a real-valued input variable x and we wish to use this observation to\\npredict the value of a real-valued target variable t. For the present purposes, it is in-\\nstructive to consider an artiﬁcial example using synthetically generated data because\\nwe then know the precise process that generated the data for comparison against any\\nlearned model. The data for this example is generated from the function sin(2πx)\\nwith random noise included in the target values, as described in detail in Appendix A.\\nNow suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x,\\nwritten x ≡(x1, . . . , xN)T, together with corresponding observations of the values\\nof t, denoted t ≡(t1, . . . , tN)T. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of a training set comprising\\nN = 10 data points. The input data set x in Figure 1.2 was generated by choos-\\ning values of xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, spaced uniformly in range [0, 1], and the target\\ndata set t was obtained by ﬁrst computing the corresponding values of the function'),\n",

By generating data in this way, we are\\ncapturing a property of many real data sets, namely that they possess an underlying\\nregularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by\\nrandom noise. This noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random) pro-\\ncesses such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of\\nvariability that are themselves unobserved.\\nOur goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions of the value\\n\\x01t of the target variable for some new value \\x01x of the input variable. As we shall see\\nlater, this involves implicitly trying to discover the underlying function sin(2πx).\\nThis is intrinsically a difﬁcult problem as we have to generalize from a ﬁnite data\\nset. Furthermore the observed data are corrupted with noise, and so for a given \\x01x\\nthere is uncertainty as to the appropriate value for \\x01t. Probability theory, discussed\\nin Section 1.2, provides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise\\nand quantitative manner, and decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to\\nexploit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal\\naccording to appropriate criteria.\\nFor the moment, however, we shall proceed rather informally and consider a\\nsimple approach based on curve ﬁtting. In particular, we shall ﬁt the data using a\\npolynomial function of the form\\ny(x, w) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 + . . . + wMxM =\\nM\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\nwjxj\\n(1.1)\\nwhere M is the order of the polynomial, and xj denotes x raised to the power of j.\\nThe polynomial coefﬁcients w0, . . . , wM are collectively denoted by the vector w.\\nNote that, although the polynomial function y(x, w) is a nonlinear function of x, it\\nis a linear function of the coefﬁcients w. Functions, such as the polynomial, which\\nare linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called linear\\nmodels and will be discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 4.\\nThe values of the coefﬁcients will be determined by ﬁtting the polynomial to the\\ntraining data. This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the\\nmisﬁt between the function y(x, w), for any given value of w, and the training set\\ndata points. One simple choice of error function, which is widely used, is given by\\nthe sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions y(xn, w) for each data\\npoint xn and the corresponding target values tn, so that we minimize\\nE(w) = 1\\n2\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n{y(xn, w) −tn}2\\n(1.2)\\nwhere the factor of 1/2 is included for later convenience.

The geomet-\\nrical interpretation of the sum-of-squares error function is illustrated in Figure 1.3.\\nWe can solve the curve ﬁtting problem by choosing the value of w for which\\nE(w) is as small as possible. Because the error function is a quadratic function of\\nthe coefﬁcients w, its derivatives with respect to the coefﬁcients will be linear in the\\nelements of w, and so the minimization of the error function has a unique solution,\\ndenoted by w⋆, which can be found in closed form. The resulting polynomial is\\nExercise 1.1\\ngiven by the function y(x, w⋆).\\nThere remains the problem of choosing the order M of the polynomial, and as\\nwe shall see this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model\\ncomparison or model selection. In Figure 1.4, we show four examples of the results\\nof ﬁtting polynomials having orders M = 0, 1, 3, and 9 to the data set shown in\\nFigure 1.2.\\nWe notice that the constant (M = 0) and ﬁrst order (M = 1) polynomials\\ngive rather poor ﬁts to the data and consequently rather poor representations of the\\nfunction sin(2πx). The third order (M = 3) polynomial seems to give the best ﬁt\\nto the function sin(2πx) of the examples shown in Figure 1.4. When we go to a\\nmuch higher order polynomial (M = 9), we obtain an excellent ﬁt to the training\\ndata. In fact, the polynomial passes exactly through each data point and E(w⋆) = 0.\\nHowever, the ﬁtted curve oscillates wildly and gives a very poor representation of\\nthe function sin(2πx). This latter behaviour is known as over-ﬁtting.\\nAs we have noted earlier, the goal is to achieve good generalization by making\\naccurate predictions for new data. We can obtain some quantitative insight into the\\ndependence of the generalization performance on M by considering a separate test\\nset comprising 100 data points generated using exactly the same procedure used\\nto generate the training set points but with new choices for the random noise values\\nincluded in the target values. For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual\\nvalue of E(w⋆) given by (1.2) for the training data, and we can also evaluate E(w⋆)\\nfor the test data set. It is sometimes more convenient to use the root-mean-square'),\n",

The M = 9 polynomial is therefore capa-\\nble of generating results at least as good as the M = 3 polynomial. Furthermore, we\\nmight suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the function sin(2πx)\\nfrom which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the\\ncase).

We see that increasing the\\nsize of the data set reduces the over-ﬁtting problem.\\ning polynomial function matches each of the data points exactly, but between data\\npoints (particularly near the ends of the range) the function exhibits the large oscilla-\\ntions observed in Figure 1.4. Intuitively, what is happening is that the more ﬂexible\\npolynomials with larger values of M are becoming increasingly tuned to the random\\nnoise on the target values.\\nIt is also interesting to examine the behaviour of a given model as the size of the\\ndata set is varied, as shown in Figure 1.6. We see that, for a given model complexity,\\nthe over-ﬁtting problem become less severe as the size of the data set increases.\\nAnother way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex (in other\\nwords more ﬂexible) the model that we can afford to ﬁt to the data. One rough\\nheuristic that is sometimes advocated is that the number of data points should be\\nno less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in\\nthe model. However, as we shall see in Chapter 3, the number of parameters is not\\nnecessarily the most appropriate measure of model complexity.\\nAlso, there is something rather unsatisfying about having to limit the number of\\nparameters in a model according to the size of the available training set. It would\\nseem more reasonable to choose the complexity of the model according to the com-\\nplexity of the problem being solved. We shall see that the least squares approach\\nto ﬁnding the model parameters represents a speciﬁc case of maximum likelihood\\n(discussed in Section 1.2.5), and that the over-ﬁtting problem can be understood as\\na general property of maximum likelihood. By adopting a Bayesian approach, the\\nSection 3.4\\nover-ﬁtting problem can be avoided. We shall see that there is no difﬁculty from\\na Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters\\ngreatly exceeds the number of data points.

Prob-\\nability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantiﬁcation and manipula-\\ntion of uncertainty and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition.\\nWhen combined with decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, it allows us to make\\noptimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that infor-\\nmation may be incomplete or ambiguous.\\nWe will introduce the basic concepts of probability theory by considering a sim-\\nple example. Imagine we have two boxes, one red and one blue, and in the red box\\nwe have 2 apples and 6 oranges, and in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange.\\nThis is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Now suppose we randomly pick one of the boxes\\nand from that box we randomly select an item of fruit, and having observed which\\nsort of fruit it is we replace it in the box from which it came. We could imagine\\nrepeating this process many times. Let us suppose that in so doing we pick the red\\nbox 40% of the time and we pick the blue box 60% of the time, and that when we\\nremove an item of fruit from a box we are equally likely to select any of the pieces\\nof fruit in the box.\\nIn this example, the identity of the box that will be chosen is a random variable,\\nwhich we shall denote by B. This random variable can take one of two possible\\nvalues, namely r (corresponding to the red box) or b (corresponding to the blue\\nbox). Similarly, the identity of the fruit is also a random variable and will be denoted\\nby F. It can take either of the values a (for apple) or o (for orange).\\nTo begin with, we shall deﬁne the probability of an event to be the fraction\\nof times that event occurs out of the total number of trials, in the limit that the total\\nnumber of trials goes to inﬁnity. Thus the probability of selecting the red box is 4/10\\nFigure 1.9\\nWe use a simple example of two\\ncoloured boxes each containing fruit\\n(apples shown in green and or-\\nanges shown in orange) to intro-\\nduce the basic ideas of probability.'),\n",

Probability Theory\\n13\\nFigure 1.10\\nWe can derive the sum and product rules of probability by\\nconsidering two random variables, X, which takes the values {xi} where\\ni = 1, . . . , M, and Y , which takes the values {yj} where j = 1, . . . , L.\\nIn this illustration we have M = 5 and L = 3. If we consider a total\\nnumber N of instances of these variables, then we denote the number\\nof instances where X = xi and Y = yj by nij, which is the number of\\npoints in the corresponding cell of the array. The number of points in\\ncolumn i, corresponding to X = xi, is denoted by ci, and the number of\\npoints in row j, corresponding to Y = yj, is denoted by rj.\\n}\\n}\\nci\\nrj\\nyj\\nxi\\nnij\\nand the probability of selecting the blue box is 6/10. We write these probabilities\\nas p(B = r) = 4/10 and p(B = b) = 6/10. Note that, by deﬁnition, probabilities\\nmust lie in the interval [0, 1]. Also, if the events are mutually exclusive and if they\\ninclude all possible outcomes (for instance, in this example the box must be either\\nred or blue), then we see that the probabilities for those events must sum to one.\\nWe can now ask questions such as: “what is the overall probability that the se-\\nlection procedure will pick an apple?”, or “given that we have chosen an orange,\\nwhat is the probability that the box we chose was the blue one?”. We can answer\\nquestions such as these, and indeed much more complex questions associated with\\nproblems in pattern recognition, once we have equipped ourselves with the two el-\\nementary rules of probability, known as the sum rule and the product rule. Having\\nobtained these rules, we shall then return to our boxes of fruit example.\\nIn order to derive the rules of probability, consider the slightly more general ex-\\nample shown in Figure 1.10 involving two random variables X and Y (which could\\nfor instance be the Box and Fruit variables considered above). We shall suppose that\\nX can take any of the values xi where i = 1, . . . , M, and Y can take the values yj\\nwhere j = 1, . . . , L. Consider a total of N trials in which we sample both of the\\nvariables X and Y , and let the number of such trials in which X = xi and Y = yj\\nbe nij. Also, let the number of trials in which X takes the value xi (irrespective\\nof the value that Y takes) be denoted by ci, and similarly let the number of trials in\\nwhich Y takes the value yj be denoted by rj.\\nThe probability that X will take the value xi and Y will take the value yj is\\nwritten p(X = xi, Y = yj) and is called the joint probability of X = xi and\\nY = yj. It is given by the number of points falling in the cell i,j as a fraction of the\\ntotal number of points, and hence\\np(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij\\nN .\\n(1.5)\\nHere we are implicitly considering the limit N →∞. Similarly, the probability that\\nX takes the value xi irrespective of the value of Y is written as p(X = xi) and is\\ngiven by the fraction of the total number of points that fall in column i, so that\\np(X = xi) = ci\\nN .\\n(1.6)\\nBecause the number of instances in column i in Figure 1.10 is just the sum of the\\nnumber of instances in each cell of that column, we have ci = \\x05\\nj nij and therefore,'),\n",

Thus the probability that B takes\\nthe value r is denoted p(B = r). Although this helps to avoid ambiguity, it leads\\nto a rather cumbersome notation, and in many cases there will be no need for such\\npedantry. Instead, we may simply write p(B) to denote a distribution over the ran-\\ndom variable B, or p(r) to denote the distribution evaluated for the particular value\\nr, provided that the interpretation is clear from the context.\\nWith this more compact notation, we can write the two fundamental rules of\\nprobability theory in the following form.\\nThe Rules of Probability\\nsum rule\\np(X) =\\n\\x02\\nY\\np(X, Y )\\n(1.10)\\nproduct rule\\np(X, Y ) = p(Y |X)p(X).\\n(1.11)\\nHere p(X, Y ) is a joint probability and is verbalized as “the probability of X and\\nY ”. Similarly, the quantity p(Y |X) is a conditional probability and is verbalized as\\n“the probability of Y given X”, whereas the quantity p(X) is a marginal probability'),\n",

Probability Theory\\n15\\nand is simply “the probability of X”. These two simple rules form the basis for all\\nof the probabilistic machinery that we use throughout this book.\\nFrom the product rule, together with the symmetry property p(X, Y ) = p(Y, X),\\nwe immediately obtain the following relationship between conditional probabilities\\np(Y |X) = p(X|Y )p(Y )\\np(X)\\n(1.12)\\nwhich is called Bayes’ theorem and which plays a central role in pattern recognition\\nand machine learning. Using the sum rule, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem can\\nbe expressed in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator\\np(X) =\\n\\x02\\nY\\np(X|Y )p(Y ).\\n(1.13)\\nWe can view the denominator in Bayes’ theorem as being the normalization constant\\nrequired to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the left-hand side of\\n(1.12) over all values of Y equals one.\\nIn Figure 1.11, we show a simple example involving a joint distribution over two\\nvariables to illustrate the concept of marginal and conditional distributions.\\nHere\\na ﬁnite sample of N = 60 data points has been drawn from the joint distribution\\nand is shown in the top left. In the top right is a histogram of the fractions of data\\npoints having each of the two values of Y . From the deﬁnition of probability, these\\nfractions would equal the corresponding probabilities p(Y ) in the limit N →∞. We\\ncan view the histogram as a simple way to model a probability distribution given only\\na ﬁnite number of points drawn from that distribution. Modelling distributions from\\ndata lies at the heart of statistical pattern recognition and will be explored in great\\ndetail in this book. The remaining two plots in Figure 1.11 show the corresponding\\nhistogram estimates of p(X) and p(X|Y = 1).\\nLet us now return to our example involving boxes of fruit. For the moment, we\\nshall once again be explicit about distinguishing between the random variables and\\ntheir instantiations. We have seen that the probabilities of selecting either the red or\\nthe blue boxes are given by\\np(B = r)\\n=\\n4/10\\n(1.14)\\np(B = b)\\n=\\n6/10\\n(1.15)\\nrespectively.

In fact, we can write out all four\\nconditional probabilities for the type of fruit, given the selected box\\np(F = a|B = r)\\n=\\n1/4\\n(1.16)\\np(F = o|B = r)\\n=\\n3/4\\n(1.17)\\np(F = a|B = b)\\n=\\n3/4\\n(1.18)\\np(F = o|B = b)\\n=\\n1/4.\\n(1.19)'),\n",

Probability Theory\\n17\\nSuppose instead we are told that a piece of fruit has been selected and it is an\\norange, and we would like to know which box it came from. This requires that\\nwe evaluate the probability distribution over boxes conditioned on the identity of\\nthe fruit, whereas the probabilities in (1.16)–(1.19) give the probability distribution\\nover the fruit conditioned on the identity of the box. We can solve the problem of\\nreversing the conditional probability by using Bayes’ theorem to give\\np(B = r|F = o) = p(F = o|B = r)p(B = r)\\np(F = o)\\n= 3\\n4 × 4\\n10 × 20\\n9 = 2\\n3.\\n(1.23)\\nFrom the sum rule, it then follows that p(B = b|F = o) = 1 −2/3 = 1/3.\\nWe can provide an important interpretation of Bayes’ theorem as follows. If\\nwe had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of\\nthe selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is\\nprovided by the probability p(B). We call this the prior probability because it is the\\nprobability available before we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that\\nthe fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability\\np(B|F), which we shall call the posterior probability because it is the probability\\nobtained after we have observed F. Note that in this example, the prior probability\\nof selecting the red box was 4/10, so that we were more likely to select the blue box\\nthan the red one. However, once we have observed that the piece of selected fruit is\\nan orange, we ﬁnd that the posterior probability of the red box is now 2/3, so that\\nit is now more likely that the box we selected was in fact the red one. This result\\naccords with our intuition, as the proportion of oranges is much higher in the red box\\nthan it is in the blue box, and so the observation that the fruit was an orange provides\\nsigniﬁcant evidence favouring the red box. In fact, the evidence is sufﬁciently strong\\nthat it outweighs the prior and makes it more likely that the red box was chosen\\nrather than the blue one.\\nFinally, we note that if the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the\\nproduct of the marginals, so that p(X, Y ) = p(X)p(Y ), then X and Y are said to\\nbe independent. From the product rule, we see that p(Y |X) = p(Y ), and so the\\nconditional distribution of Y given X is indeed independent of the value of X. For\\ninstance, in our boxes of fruit example, if each box contained the same fraction of\\napples and oranges, then p(F|B) = P(F), so that the probability of selecting, say,\\nan apple is independent of which box is chosen.\\n1.2.1\\nProbability densities\\nAs well as considering probabilities deﬁned over discrete sets of events, we\\nalso wish to consider probabilities with respect to continuous variables. We shall\\nlimit ourselves to a relatively informal discussion. If the probability of a real-valued\\nvariable x falling in the interval (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx for δx →0, then\\np(x) is called the probability density over x. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12. The\\nprobability that x will lie in an interval (a, b) is then given by\\np(x ∈(a, b)) =\\n\\x06 b\\na\\np(x) dx.\\n(1.24)'),\n",

For instance, if we consider\\na change of variables x = g(y), then a function f(x) becomes \\x04f(y) = f(g(y)).\\nNow consider a probability density px(x) that corresponds to a density py(y) with\\nrespect to the new variable y, where the sufﬁces denote the fact that px(x) and py(y)\\nare different densities.

Probability Theory\\n21\\n1.2.3\\nBayesian probabilities\\nSo far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of the frequencies\\nof random, repeatable events. We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist\\ninterpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in\\nwhich probabilities provide a quantiﬁcation of uncertainty.\\nConsider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own\\norbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end\\nof the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order\\nto deﬁne a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit.\\nNevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we\\nthink the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a\\nnew Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we\\nmay revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will\\naffect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce\\nthe emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able\\nto quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in\\nthe light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions\\nor decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very\\ngeneral, Bayesian interpretation of probability.\\nThe use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice,\\nbut is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent\\ninferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to\\nrepresent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense\\nproperties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of\\nbelief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided\\nthe ﬁrst rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of\\nBoolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other\\nauthors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of\\nuncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti,\\n1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre-\\ncisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these\\nquantities as (Bayesian) probabilities.\\nIn the ﬁeld of pattern recognition, too, it is helpful to have a more general no-\\nThomas Bayes\\n1701–1761\\nThomas Bayes was born in Tun-\\nbridge Wells and was a clergyman\\nas well as an amateur scientist and\\na mathematician.

INTRODUCTION\\ntion of probability. Consider the example of polynomial curve ﬁtting discussed in\\nSection 1.1. It seems reasonable to apply the frequentist notion of probability to the\\nrandom values of the observed variables tn. However, we would like to address and\\nquantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model param-\\neters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery\\nof probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or\\nindeed in the choice of model itself.\\nBayes’ theorem now acquires a new signiﬁcance. Recall that in the boxes of fruit\\nexample, the observation of the identity of the fruit provided relevant information\\nthat altered the probability that the chosen box was the red one. In that example,\\nBayes’ theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability\\nby incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data. As we shall see in\\ndetail later, we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities\\nsuch as the parameters w in the polynomial curve ﬁtting example. We capture our\\nassumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a prior probability\\ndistribution p(w). The effect of the observed data D = {t1, . . . , tN} is expressed\\nthrough the conditional probability p(D|w), and we shall see later, in Section 1.2.5,\\nhow this can be represented explicitly. Bayes’ theorem, which takes the form\\np(w|D) = p(D|w)p(w)\\np(D)\\n(1.43)\\nthen allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form\\nof the posterior probability p(w|D).\\nThe quantity p(D|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes’ theorem is evaluated for\\nthe observed data set D and can be viewed as a function of the parameter vector\\nw, in which case it is called the likelihood function. It expresses how probable the\\nobserved data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w. Note that the\\nlikelihood is not a probability distribution over w, and its integral with respect to w\\ndoes not (necessarily) equal one.\\nGiven this deﬁnition of likelihood, we can state Bayes’ theorem in words\\nposterior ∝likelihood × prior\\n(1.44)\\nwhere all of these quantities are viewed as functions of w. The denominator in\\n(1.43) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the posterior distribution\\non the left-hand side is a valid probability density and integrates to one. Indeed,\\nintegrating both sides of (1.43) with respect to w, we can express the denominator\\nin Bayes’ theorem in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihood function\\np(D) =\\n\\x06\\np(D|w)p(w) dw.\\n(1.45)\\nIn both the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms, the likelihood function p(D|w)\\nplays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif-\\nferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a ﬁxed\\nparameter, whose value is determined by some form of ‘estimator’, and error bars'),\n",

Probability Theory\\n23\\non this estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets D.\\nBy contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely\\nthe one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed\\nthrough a probability distribution over w.\\nA widely used frequentist estimator is maximum likelihood, in which w is set\\nto the value that maximizes the likelihood function p(D|w). This corresponds to\\nchoosing the value of w for which the probability of the observed data set is maxi-\\nmized. In the machine learning literature, the negative log of the likelihood function\\nis called an error function. Because the negative logarithm is a monotonically de-\\ncreasing function, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the error.\\nOne approach to determining frequentist error bars is the bootstrap (Efron, 1979;\\nHastie et al., 2001), in which multiple data sets are created as follows. Suppose our\\noriginal data set consists of N data points X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We can create a new\\ndata set XB by drawing N points at random from X, with replacement, so that some\\npoints in X may be replicated in XB, whereas other points in X may be absent from\\nXB. This process can be repeated L times to generate L data sets each of size N and\\neach obtained by sampling from the original data set X. The statistical accuracy of\\nparameter estimates can then be evaluated by looking at the variability of predictions\\nbetween the different bootstrap data sets.\\nOne advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior knowl-\\nedge arises naturally. Suppose, for instance, that a fair-looking coin is tossed three\\ntimes and lands heads each time. A classical maximum likelihood estimate of the\\nprobability of landing heads would give 1, implying that all future tosses will land\\nSection 2.1\\nheads! By contrast, a Bayesian approach with any reasonable prior will lead to a\\nmuch less extreme conclusion.\\nThere has been much controversy and debate associated with the relative mer-\\nits of the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, which have not been helped by the\\nfact that there is no unique frequentist, or even Bayesian, viewpoint. For instance,\\none common criticism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution is of-\\nten selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than as a reﬂection of\\nany prior beliefs. Even the subjective nature of the conclusions through their de-\\npendence on the choice of prior is seen by some as a source of difﬁculty. Reducing\\nthe dependence on the prior is one motivation for so-called noninformative priors.\\nSection 2.4.3\\nHowever, these lead to difﬁculties when comparing different models, and indeed\\nBayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with high\\nconﬁdence. Frequentist evaluation methods offer some protection from such prob-\\nlems, and techniques such as cross-validation remain useful in areas such as model\\nSection 1.3\\ncomparison.\\nThis book places a strong emphasis on the Bayesian viewpoint, reﬂecting the\\nhuge growth in the practical importance of Bayesian methods in the past few years,\\nwhile also discussing useful frequentist concepts as required.\\nAlthough the Bayesian framework has its origins in the 18th century, the prac-\\ntical application of Bayesian methods was for a long time severely limited by the\\ndifﬁculties in carrying through the full Bayesian procedure, particularly the need to\\nmarginalize (sum or integrate) over the whole of parameter space, which, as we shall'),\n",

The\\ndevelopment of sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (discussed in\\nChapter 11) along with dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity\\nof computers, opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an im-\\npressive range of problem domains. Monte Carlo methods are very ﬂexible and can\\nbe applied to a wide range of models. However, they are computationally intensive\\nand have mainly been used for small-scale problems.\\nMore recently, highly efﬁcient deterministic approximation schemes such as\\nvariational Bayes and expectation propagation (discussed in Chapter 10) have been\\ndeveloped. These offer a complementary alternative to sampling methods and have\\nallowed Bayesian techniques to be used in large-scale applications (Blei et al., 2003).\\n1.2.4\\nThe Gaussian distribution\\nWe shall devote the whole of Chapter 2 to a study of various probability dis-\\ntributions and their key properties. It is convenient, however, to introduce here one\\nof the most important probability distributions for continuous variables, called the\\nnormal or Gaussian distribution. We shall make extensive use of this distribution in\\nthe remainder of this chapter and indeed throughout much of the book.\\nFor the case of a single real-valued variable x, the Gaussian distribution is de-\\nﬁned by\\nN\\n\\nx|µ, σ2\\x0b\\n=\\n1\\n(2πσ2)1/2 exp\\n\\x0c\\n−1\\n2σ2 (x −µ)2\\n\\r\\n(1.46)\\nwhich is governed by two parameters: µ, called the mean, and σ2, called the vari-\\nance. The square root of the variance, given by σ, is called the standard deviation,\\nand the reciprocal of the variance, written as β = 1/σ2, is called the precision. We\\nshall see the motivation for these terms shortly. Figure 1.13 shows a plot of the\\nGaussian distribution.\\nFrom the form of (1.46) we see that the Gaussian distribution satisﬁes\\nN(x|µ, σ2) > 0.\\n(1.47)\\nAlso it is straightforward to show that the Gaussian is normalized, so that\\nExercise 1.7\\nPierre-Simon Laplace\\n1749–1827\\nIt is said that Laplace was seri-\\nously lacking in modesty and at one\\npoint declared himself to be the\\nbest mathematician in France at the\\ntime, a claim that was arguably true.\\nAs well as being proliﬁc in mathe-\\nmatics, he also made numerous contributions to as-\\ntronomy, including the nebular hypothesis by which the\\nearth is thought to have formed from the condensa-\\ntion and cooling of a large rotating disk of gas and\\ndust. In 1812 he published the ﬁrst edition of Th´eorie\\nAnalytique des Probabilit´es, in which Laplace states\\nthat “probability theory is nothing but common sense\\nreduced to calculation”.

We shall suppose that the observations are\\ndrawn independently from a Gaussian distribution whose mean µ and variance σ2\\nare unknown, and we would like to determine these parameters from the data set.\\nData points that are drawn independently from the same distribution are said to be\\nindependent and identically distributed, which is often abbreviated to i.i.d. We have\\nseen that the joint probability of two independent events is given by the product of\\nthe marginal probabilities for each event separately.

Here we return to the curve ﬁtting example and view it\\nSection 1.1\\nfrom a probabilistic perspective, thereby gaining some insights into error functions\\nand regularization, as well as taking us towards a full Bayesian treatment.\\nThe goal in the curve ﬁtting problem is to be able to make predictions for the\\ntarget variable t given some new value of the input variable x on the basis of a set of\\ntraining data comprising N input values x = (x1, . . . , xN)T and their corresponding\\ntarget values t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We can express our uncertainty over the value of\\nthe target variable using a probability distribution. For this purpose, we shall assume\\nthat, given the value of x, the corresponding value of t has a Gaussian distribution\\nwith a mean equal to the value y(x, w) of the polynomial curve given by (1.1). Thus\\nwe have\\np(t|x, w, β) = N \\nt|y(x, w), β−1\\x0b\\n(1.60)\\nwhere, for consistency with the notation in later chapters, we have deﬁned a preci-\\nsion parameter β corresponding to the inverse variance of the distribution.

Model Selection\\nIn our example of polynomial curve ﬁtting using least squares, we saw that there was\\nan optimal order of polynomial that gave the best generalization. The order of the\\npolynomial controls the number of free parameters in the model and thereby governs\\nthe model complexity. With regularized least squares, the regularization coefﬁcient\\nλ also controls the effective complexity of the model, whereas for more complex\\nmodels, such as mixture distributions or neural networks there may be multiple pa-\\nrameters governing complexity. In a practical application, we need to determine\\nthe values of such parameters, and the principal objective in doing so is usually to\\nachieve the best predictive performance on new data. Furthermore, as well as ﬁnd-\\ning the appropriate values for complexity parameters within a given model, we may\\nwish to consider a range of different types of model in order to ﬁnd the best one for\\nour particular application.\\nWe have already seen that, in the maximum likelihood approach, the perfor-\\nmance on the training set is not a good indicator of predictive performance on un-\\nseen data due to the problem of over-ﬁtting. If data is plentiful, then one approach is\\nsimply to use some of the available data to train a range of models, or a given model\\nwith a range of values for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on\\nindependent data, sometimes called a validation set, and select the one having the\\nbest predictive performance. If the model design is iterated many times using a lim-\\nited size data set, then some over-ﬁtting to the validation data can occur and so it may\\nbe necessary to keep aside a third test set on which the performance of the selected\\nmodel is ﬁnally evaluated.\\nIn many applications, however, the supply of data for training and testing will be\\nlimited, and in order to build good models, we wish to use as much of the available\\ndata as possible for training. However, if the validation set is small, it will give a\\nrelatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is\\nto use cross-validation, which is illustrated in Figure 1.18.

When data is particularly scarce, it may be appropriate\\nto consider the case S = N, where N is the total number of data points, which gives\\nthe leave-one-out technique.\\nOne major drawback of cross-validation is that the number of training runs that\\nmust be performed is increased by a factor of S, and this can prove problematic for\\nmodels in which the training is itself computationally expensive. A further problem\\nwith techniques such as cross-validation that use separate data to assess performance\\nis that we might have multiple complexity parameters for a single model (for in-\\nstance, there might be several regularization parameters). Exploring combinations\\nof settings for such parameters could, in the worst case, require a number of training\\nruns that is exponential in the number of parameters. Clearly, we need a better ap-\\nproach. Ideally, this should rely only on the training data and should allow multiple\\nhyperparameters and model types to be compared in a single training run. We there-\\nfore need to ﬁnd a measure of performance which depends only on the training data\\nand which does not suffer from bias due to over-ﬁtting.\\nHistorically various ‘information criteria’ have been proposed that attempt to\\ncorrect for the bias of maximum likelihood by the addition of a penalty term to\\ncompensate for the over-ﬁtting of more complex models. For example, the Akaike\\ninformation criterion, or AIC (Akaike, 1974), chooses the model for which the quan-\\ntity\\nln p(D|wML) −M\\n(1.73)\\nis largest. Here p(D|wML) is the best-ﬁt log likelihood, and M is the number of\\nadjustable parameters in the model. A variant of this quantity, called the Bayesian\\ninformation criterion, or BIC, will be discussed in Section 4.4.1. Such criteria do\\nnot take account of the uncertainty in the model parameters, however, and in practice\\nthey tend to favour overly simple models. We therefore turn in Section 3.4 to a fully\\nBayesian approach where we shall see how complexity penalties arise in a natural\\nand principled way.\\n1.4.

These three materials can be present in one\\nof three different geometrical conﬁgurations known as ‘homogenous’, ‘annular’, and\\n‘laminar’, and the fractions of the three materials can also vary. Each data point com-\\nprises a 12-dimensional input vector consisting of measurements taken with gamma\\nray densitometers that measure the attenuation of gamma rays passing along nar-\\nrow beams through the pipe. This data set is described in detail in Appendix A.\\nFigure 1.19 shows 100 points from this data set on a plot showing two of the mea-\\nsurements x6 and x7 (the remaining ten input values are ignored for the purposes of\\nthis illustration). Each data point is labelled according to which of the three geomet-\\nrical classes it belongs to, and our goal is to use this data as a training set in order to\\nbe able to classify a new observation (x6, x7), such as the one denoted by the cross\\nin Figure 1.19. We observe that the cross is surrounded by numerous red points, and\\nso we might suppose that it belongs to the red class. However, there are also plenty\\nof green points nearby, so we might think that it could instead belong to the green\\nclass. It seems unlikely that it belongs to the blue class. The intuition here is that the\\nidentity of the cross should be determined more strongly by nearby points from the\\ntraining set and less strongly by more distant points. In fact, this intuition turns out\\nto be reasonable and will be discussed more fully in later chapters.\\nHow can we turn this intuition into a learning algorithm? One very simple ap-\\nproach would be to divide the input space into regular cells, as indicated in Fig-\\nure 1.20. When we are given a test point and we wish to predict its class, we ﬁrst\\ndecide which cell it belongs to, and we then ﬁnd all of the training data points that'),\n",

(1.74)\\nAs D increases, so the number of independent coefﬁcients (not all of the coefﬁcients\\nare independent due to interchange symmetries amongst the x variables) grows pro-\\nportionally to D3. In practice, to capture complex dependencies in the data, we may\\nneed to use a higher-order polynomial. For a polynomial of order M, the growth in\\nthe number of coefﬁcients is like DM. Although this is now a power law growth,\\nExercise 1.16\\nrather than an exponential growth, it still points to the method becoming rapidly\\nunwieldy and of limited practical utility.\\nOur geometrical intuitions, formed through a life spent in a space of three di-\\nmensions, can fail badly when we consider spaces of higher dimensionality. As a\\nsimple example, consider a sphere of radius r = 1 in a space of D dimensions, and\\nask what is the fraction of the volume of the sphere that lies between radius r = 1−ϵ\\nand r = 1. We can evaluate this fraction by noting that the volume of a sphere of\\nradius r in D dimensions must scale as rD, and so we write\\nVD(r) = KDrD\\n(1.75)\\nwhere the constant KD depends only on D. Thus the required fraction is given by\\nExercise 1.18\\nVD(1) −VD(1 −ϵ)\\nVD(1)\\n= 1 −(1 −ϵ)D\\n(1.76)\\nwhich is plotted as a function of ϵ for various values of D in Figure 1.22. We see\\nthat, for large D, this fraction tends to 1 even for small values of ϵ. Thus, in spaces\\nof high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell\\nnear the surface!\\nAs a further example, of direct relevance to pattern recognition, consider the\\nbehaviour of a Gaussian distribution in a high-dimensional space. If we transform\\nfrom Cartesian to polar coordinates, and then integrate out the directional variables,\\nwe obtain an expression for the density p(r) as a function of radius r from the origin.\\nExercise 1.20\\nThus p(r)δr is the probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness δr located at\\nradius r. This distribution is plotted, for various values of D, in Figure 1.23, and we\\nsee that for large D the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a thin\\nshell.\\nThe severe difﬁculty that can arise in spaces of many dimensions is sometimes\\ncalled the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961).

The reasons for this are twofold. First, real\\ndata will often be conﬁned to a region of the space having lower effective dimension-\\nality, and in particular the directions over which important variations in the target\\nvariables occur may be so conﬁned. Second, real data will typically exhibit some\\nsmoothness properties (at least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the\\ninput variables will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can ex-\\nploit local interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target\\nvariables for new values of the input variables. Successful pattern recognition tech-\\nniques exploit one or both of these properties.

INTRODUCTION\\nin a high-dimensional space whose dimensionality is determined by the number of\\npixels. Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and\\nin different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between\\nimages, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded\\nwithin the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the\\nobject position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly\\nnonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the\\norientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of\\nfreedom of variability within the manifold that is signiﬁcant.\\n1.5. Decision Theory\\nWe have seen in Section 1.2 how probability theory provides us with a consistent\\nmathematical framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty. Here we\\nturn to a discussion of decision theory that, when combined with probability theory,\\nallows us to make optimal decisions in situations involving uncertainty such as those\\nencountered in pattern recognition.\\nSuppose we have an input vector x together with a corresponding vector t of\\ntarget variables, and our goal is to predict t given a new value for x. For regression\\nproblems, t will comprise continuous variables, whereas for classiﬁcation problems\\nt will represent class labels. The joint probability distribution p(x, t) provides a\\ncomplete summary of the uncertainty associated with these variables. Determination\\nof p(x, t) from a set of training data is an example of inference and is typically a\\nvery difﬁcult problem whose solution forms the subject of much of this book. In\\na practical application, however, we must often make a speciﬁc prediction for the\\nvalue of t, or more generally take a speciﬁc action based on our understanding of the\\nvalues t is likely to take, and this aspect is the subject of decision theory.\\nConsider, for example, a medical diagnosis problem in which we have taken an\\nX-ray image of a patient, and we wish to determine whether the patient has cancer\\nor not. In this case, the input vector x is the set of pixel intensities in the image,\\nand output variable t will represent the presence of cancer, which we denote by the\\nclass C1, or the absence of cancer, which we denote by the class C2. We might, for\\ninstance, choose t to be a binary variable such that t = 0 corresponds to class C1 and\\nt = 1 corresponds to class C2. We shall see later that this choice of label values is\\nparticularly convenient for probabilistic models. The general inference problem then\\ninvolves determining the joint distribution p(x, Ck), or equivalently p(x, t), which\\ngives us the most complete probabilistic description of the situation. Although this\\ncan be a very useful and informative quantity, in the end we must decide either to\\ngive treatment to the patient or not, and we would like this choice to be optimal\\nin some appropriate sense (Duda and Hart, 1973). This is the decision step, and\\nit is the subject of decision theory to tell us how to make optimal decisions given\\nthe appropriate probabilities. We shall see that the decision stage is generally very\\nsimple, even trivial, once we have solved the inference problem.\\nHere we give an introduction to the key ideas of decision theory as required for'),\n",

Decision Theory\\n39\\nthe rest of the book. Further background, as well as more detailed accounts, can be\\nfound in Berger (1985) and Bather (2000).\\nBefore giving a more detailed analysis, let us ﬁrst consider informally how we\\nmight expect probabilities to play a role in making decisions. When we obtain the\\nX-ray image x for a new patient, our goal is to decide which of the two classes to\\nassign to the image. We are interested in the probabilities of the two classes given\\nthe image, which are given by p(Ck|x). Using Bayes’ theorem, these probabilities\\ncan be expressed in the form\\np(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)\\np(x)\\n.\\n(1.77)\\nNote that any of the quantities appearing in Bayes’ theorem can be obtained from\\nthe joint distribution p(x, Ck) by either marginalizing or conditioning with respect to\\nthe appropriate variables. We can now interpret p(Ck) as the prior probability for the\\nclass Ck, and p(Ck|x) as the corresponding posterior probability. Thus p(C1) repre-\\nsents the probability that a person has cancer, before we take the X-ray measurement.\\nSimilarly, p(C1|x) is the corresponding probability, revised using Bayes’ theorem in\\nlight of the information contained in the X-ray. If our aim is to minimize the chance\\nof assigning x to the wrong class, then intuitively we would choose the class having\\nthe higher posterior probability. We now show that this intuition is correct, and we\\nalso discuss more general criteria for making decisions.\\n1.5.1\\nMinimizing the misclassiﬁcation rate\\nSuppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassiﬁcations as possible.\\nWe need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a\\nrule will divide the input space into regions Rk called decision regions, one for each\\nclass, such that all points in Rk are assigned to class Ck. The boundaries between\\ndecision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. Note that each\\ndecision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint\\nregions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in\\nlater chapters. In order to ﬁnd the optimal decision rule, consider ﬁrst of all the case\\nof two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input\\nvector belonging to class C1 is assigned to class C2 or vice versa. The probability of\\nthis occurring is given by\\np(mistake)\\n=\\np(x ∈R1, C2) + p(x ∈R2, C1)\\n=\\n\\x06\\nR1\\np(x, C2) dx +\\n\\x06\\nR2\\np(x, C1) dx.\\n(1.78)\\nWe are free to choose the decision rule that assigns each point x to one of the two\\nclasses. Clearly to minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to\\nwhichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if p(x, C1) >\\np(x, C2) for a given value of x, then we should assign that x to class C1. From the\\nproduct rule of probability we have p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x). Because the factor\\np(x) is common to both terms, we can restate this result as saying that the minimum'),\n",

As we vary the location bx of the decision boundary, the combined areas of the\\nblue and green regions remains constant, whereas the size of the red region varies. The\\noptimal choice for bx is where the curves for p(x, C1) and p(x, C2) cross, corresponding to\\nbx = x0, because in this case the red region disappears.

Let us consider again the medical diagnosis\\nproblem. We note that, if a patient who does not have cancer is incorrectly diagnosed\\nas having cancer, the consequences may be some patient distress plus the need for\\nfurther investigations. Conversely, if a patient with cancer is diagnosed as healthy,\\nthe result may be premature death due to lack of treatment. Thus the consequences\\nof these two types of mistake can be dramatically different. It would clearly be better\\nto make fewer mistakes of the second kind, even if this was at the expense of making\\nmore mistakes of the ﬁrst kind.\\nWe can formalize such issues through the introduction of a loss function, also\\ncalled a cost function, which is a single, overall measure of loss incurred in taking\\nany of the available decisions or actions. Our goal is then to minimize the total loss\\nincurred. Note that some authors consider instead a utility function, whose value\\nthey aim to maximize. These are equivalent concepts if we take the utility to be\\nsimply the negative of the loss, and throughout this text we shall use the loss function\\nconvention. Suppose that, for a new value of x, the true class is Ck and that we assign\\nx to class Cj (where j may or may not be equal to k). In so doing, we incur some\\nlevel of loss that we denote by Lkj, which we can view as the k, j element of a loss\\nmatrix. For instance, in our cancer example, we might have a loss matrix of the form\\nshown in Figure 1.25. This particular loss matrix says that there is no loss incurred\\nif the correct decision is made, there is a loss of 1 if a healthy patient is diagnosed as\\nhaving cancer, whereas there is a loss of 1000 if a patient having cancer is diagnosed\\nas healthy.\\nThe optimal solution is the one which minimizes the loss function. However,\\nthe loss function depends on the true class, which is unknown. For a given input\\nvector x, our uncertainty in the true class is expressed through the joint probability\\ndistribution p(x, Ck) and so we seek instead to minimize the average loss, where the\\naverage is computed with respect to this distribution, which is given by\\nE[L] =\\n\\x02\\nk\\n\\x02\\nj\\n\\x06\\nRj\\nLkjp(x, Ck) dx.\\n(1.80)\\nEach x can be assigned independently to one of the decision regions Rj.

As before, we can use\\nthe product rule p(x, Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x) to eliminate the common factor of p(x).\\nThus the decision rule that minimizes the expected loss is the one that assigns each'),\n",

These\\nare the regions where we are relatively uncertain about class membership. In some\\napplications, it will be appropriate to avoid making decisions on the difﬁcult cases\\nin anticipation of a lower error rate on those examples for which a classiﬁcation de-\\ncision is made. This is known as the reject option. For example, in our hypothetical\\nmedical illustration, it may be appropriate to use an automatic system to classify\\nthose X-ray images for which there is little doubt as to the correct class, while leav-\\ning a human expert to classify the more ambiguous cases. We can achieve this by\\nintroducing a threshold θ and rejecting those inputs x for which the largest of the\\nposterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is less than or equal to θ. This is illustrated for the\\ncase of two classes, and a single continuous input variable x, in Figure 1.26. Note\\nthat setting θ = 1 will ensure that all examples are rejected, whereas if there are K\\nclasses then setting θ < 1/K will ensure that no examples are rejected. Thus the\\nfraction of examples that get rejected is controlled by the value of θ.\\nWe can easily extend the reject criterion to minimize the expected loss, when\\na loss matrix is given, taking account of the loss incurred when a reject decision is\\nmade.\\nExercise 1.24\\n1.5.4\\nInference and decision\\nWe have broken the classiﬁcation problem down into two separate stages, the\\ninference stage in which we use training data to learn a model for p(Ck|x), and the'),\n",

An alternative possibility would be to solve both problems\\ntogether and simply learn a function that maps inputs x directly into decisions. Such\\na function is called a discriminant function.\\nIn fact, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving decision problems,\\nall of which have been used in practical applications. These are given, in decreasing\\norder of complexity, by:\\n(a) First solve the inference problem of determining the class-conditional densities\\np(x|Ck) for each class Ck individually. Also separately infer the prior class\\nprobabilities p(Ck). Then use Bayes’ theorem in the form\\np(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)\\np(x)\\n(1.82)\\nto ﬁnd the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x). As usual, the denominator\\nin Bayes’ theorem can be found in terms of the quantities appearing in the\\nnumerator, because\\np(x) =\\n\\x02\\nk\\np(x|Ck)p(Ck).\\n(1.83)\\nEquivalently, we can model the joint distribution p(x, Ck) directly and then\\nnormalize to obtain the posterior probabilities. Having found the posterior\\nprobabilities, we use decision theory to determine class membership for each\\nnew input x. Approaches that explicitly or implicitly model the distribution of\\ninputs as well as outputs are known as generative models, because by sampling\\nfrom them it is possible to generate synthetic data points in the input space.\\n(b) First solve the inference problem of determining the posterior class probabilities\\np(Ck|x), and then subsequently use decision theory to assign each new x to\\none of the classes. Approaches that model the posterior probabilities directly\\nare called discriminative models.\\n(c) Find a function f(x), called a discriminant function, which maps each input x\\ndirectly onto a class label. For instance, in the case of two-class problems,\\nf(·) might be binary valued and such that f = 0 represents class C1 and f = 1\\nrepresents class C2. In this case, probabilities play no role.\\nLet us consider the relative merits of these three alternatives. Approach (a) is the\\nmost demanding because it involves ﬁnding the joint distribution over both x and\\nCk. For many applications, x will have high dimensionality, and consequently we\\nmay need a large training set in order to be able to determine the class-conditional\\ndensities to reasonable accuracy. Note that the class priors p(Ck) can often be esti-\\nmated simply from the fractions of the training set data points in each of the classes.\\nOne advantage of approach (a), however, is that it also allows the marginal density\\nof data p(x) to be determined from (1.83). This can be useful for detecting new data\\npoints that have low probability under the model and for which the predictions may'),\n",

If we used such a data set to train an adaptive model, we could run into\\nsevere difﬁculties due to the small proportion of the cancer class. For instance,\\na classiﬁer that assigned every point to the normal class would already achieve\\n99.9% accuracy and it would be difﬁcult to avoid this trivial solution. Also,\\neven a large data set will contain very few examples of X-ray images corre-\\nsponding to cancer, and so the learning algorithm will not be exposed to a\\nbroad range of examples of such images and hence is not likely to generalize\\nwell. A balanced data set in which we have selected equal numbers of exam-\\nples from each of the classes would allow us to ﬁnd a more accurate model.\\nHowever, we then have to compensate for the effects of our modiﬁcations to\\nthe training data. Suppose we have used such a modiﬁed data set and found\\nmodels for the posterior probabilities. From Bayes’ theorem (1.82), we see that\\nthe posterior probabilities are proportional to the prior probabilities, which we\\ncan interpret as the fractions of points in each class. We can therefore simply\\ntake the posterior probabilities obtained from our artiﬁcially balanced data set\\nand ﬁrst divide by the class fractions in that data set and then multiply by the\\nclass fractions in the population to which we wish to apply the model. Finally,\\nwe need to normalize to ensure that the new posterior probabilities sum to one.\\nNote that this procedure cannot be applied if we have learned a discriminant\\nfunction directly instead of determining posterior probabilities.\\nCombining models. For complex applications, we may wish to break the problem\\ninto a number of smaller subproblems each of which can be tackled by a sep-\\narate module. For example, in our hypothetical medical diagnosis problem,\\nwe may have information available from, say, blood tests as well as X-ray im-\\nages. Rather than combine all of this heterogeneous information into one huge\\ninput space, it may be more effective to build one system to interpret the X-\\nray images and a different one to interpret the blood data. As long as each of\\nthe two models gives posterior probabilities for the classes, we can combine\\nthe outputs systematically using the rules of probability. One simple way to\\ndo this is to assume that, for each class separately, the distributions of inputs\\nfor the X-ray images, denoted by xI, and the blood data, denoted by xB, are'),\n",

Our measure of information content will therefore depend\\non the probability distribution p(x), and we therefore look for a quantity h(x) that\\nis a monotonic function of the probability p(x) and that expresses the information\\ncontent. The form of h(·) can be found by noting that if we have two events x\\nand y that are unrelated, then the information gain from observing both of them\\nshould be the sum of the information gained from each of them separately, so that\\nh(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). Two unrelated events will be statistically independent and\\nso p(x, y) = p(x)p(y).

INTRODUCTION\\ntion (1.92) and the corresponding entropy (1.93). We now show that these deﬁnitions\\nindeed possess useful properties. Consider a random variable x having 8 possible\\nstates, each of which is equally likely. In order to communicate the value of x to\\na receiver, we would need to transmit a message of length 3 bits. Notice that the\\nentropy of this variable is given by\\nH[x] = −8 × 1\\n8 log2\\n1\\n8 = 3 bits.\\nNow consider an example (Cover and Thomas, 1991) of a variable having 8 pos-\\nsible states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} for which the respective probabilities are given by\\n( 1\\n2, 1\\n4, 1\\n8, 1\\n16, 1\\n64, 1\\n64, 1\\n64, 1\\n64). The entropy in this case is given by\\nH[x] = −1\\n2 log2\\n1\\n2 −1\\n4 log2\\n1\\n4 −1\\n8 log2\\n1\\n8 −1\\n16 log2\\n1\\n16 −4\\n64 log2\\n1\\n64 = 2 bits.\\nWe see that the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy than the uniform one,\\nand we shall gain some insight into this shortly when we discuss the interpretation of\\nentropy in terms of disorder. For the moment, let us consider how we would transmit\\nthe identity of the variable’s state to a receiver. We could do this, as before, using\\na 3-bit number. However, we can take advantage of the nonuniform distribution by\\nusing shorter codes for the more probable events, at the expense of longer codes for\\nthe less probable events, in the hope of getting a shorter average code length. This\\ncan be done by representing the states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} using, for instance, the\\nfollowing set of code strings: 0, 10, 110, 1110, 111100, 111101, 111110, 111111.\\nThe average length of the code that has to be transmitted is then\\naverage code length = 1\\n2 × 1 + 1\\n4 × 2 + 1\\n8 × 3 + 1\\n16 × 4 + 4 × 1\\n64 × 6 = 2 bits\\nwhich again is the same as the entropy of the random variable. Note that shorter code\\nstrings cannot be used because it must be possible to disambiguate a concatenation\\nof such strings into its component parts. For instance, 11001110 decodes uniquely\\ninto the state sequence c, a, d.\\nThis relation between entropy and shortest coding length is a general one. The\\nnoiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that the entropy is a lower bound\\non the number of bits needed to transmit the state of a random variable.\\nFrom now on, we shall switch to the use of natural logarithms in deﬁning en-\\ntropy, as this will provide a more convenient link with ideas elsewhere in this book.\\nIn this case, the entropy is measured in units of ‘nats’ instead of bits, which differ\\nsimply by a factor of ln 2.\\nWe have introduced the concept of entropy in terms of the average amount of\\ninformation needed to specify the state of a random variable. In fact, the concept of\\nentropy has much earlier origins in physics where it was introduced in the context\\nof equilibrium thermodynamics and later given a deeper interpretation as a measure\\nof disorder through developments in statistical mechanics. We can understand this\\nalternative view of entropy by considering a set of N identical objects that are to be\\ndivided amongst a set of bins, such that there are ni objects in the ith bin.

In order for this maximum to be well deﬁned, it will be nec-\\nessary to constrain the ﬁrst and second moments of p(x) as well as preserving the\\nnormalization constraint. We therefore maximize the differential entropy with the\\nLudwig Boltzmann\\n1844–1906\\nLudwig Eduard Boltzmann was an\\nAustrian physicist who created the\\nﬁeld of statistical mechanics. Prior\\nto Boltzmann, the concept of en-\\ntropy\\nwas\\nalready\\nknown\\nfrom\\nclassical thermodynamics where it\\nquantiﬁes the fact that when we take energy from a\\nsystem, not all of that energy is typically available\\nto do useful work. Boltzmann showed that the ther-\\nmodynamic entropy S, a macroscopic quantity, could\\nbe related to the statistical properties at the micro-\\nscopic level. This is expressed through the famous\\nequation S\\n= k ln W in which W represents the\\nnumber of possible microstates in a macrostate, and\\nk ≃1.38 × 10−23 (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is\\nknown as Boltzmann’s constant.\\nBoltzmann’s ideas\\nwere disputed by many scientists of they day. One dif-\\nﬁculty they saw arose from the second law of thermo-\\ndynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed\\nsystem tends to increase with time. By contrast, at\\nthe microscopic level the classical Newtonian equa-\\ntions of physics are reversible, and so they found it\\ndifﬁcult to see how the latter could explain the for-\\nmer.\\nThey didn’t fully appreciate Boltzmann’s argu-\\nments, which were statistical in nature and which con-\\ncluded not that entropy could never decrease over\\ntime but simply that with overwhelming probability it\\nwould generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long-\\nrunning dispute with the editor of the leading German\\nphysics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms\\nand molecules as anything other than convenient the-\\noretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work\\nlead to bouts of depression, and eventually he com-\\nmitted suicide. Shortly after Boltzmann’s death, new\\nexperiments by Perrin on colloidal suspensions veri-\\nﬁed his theories and conﬁrmed the value of the Boltz-\\nmann constant.

In fact, −ln x is a strictly convex function,\\nso the equality will hold if, and only if, q(x) = p(x) for all x. Thus we can in-\\nterpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of the dissimilarity of the two\\ndistributions p(x) and q(x).\\nWe see that there is an intimate relationship between data compression and den-\\nsity estimation (i.e., the problem of modelling an unknown probability distribution)\\nbecause the most efﬁcient compression is achieved when we know the true distri-\\nbution. If we use a distribution that is different from the true one, then we must\\nnecessarily have a less efﬁcient coding, and on average the additional information\\nthat must be transmitted is (at least) equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-\\ntween the two distributions.\\nSuppose that data is being generated from an unknown distribution p(x) that we\\nwish to model. We can try to approximate this distribution using some parametric\\ndistribution q(x|θ), governed by a set of adjustable parameters θ, for example a\\nmultivariate Gaussian. One way to determine θ is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler\\ndivergence between p(x) and q(x|θ) with respect to θ. We cannot do this directly\\nbecause we don’t know p(x). Suppose, however, that we have observed a ﬁnite set\\nof training points xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, drawn from p(x). Then the expectation\\nwith respect to p(x) can be approximated by a ﬁnite sum over these points, using\\n(1.35), so that\\nKL(p∥q) ≃\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n{−ln q(xn|θ) + ln p(xn)} .\\n(1.119)\\nThe second term on the right-hand side of (1.119) is independent of θ, and the ﬁrst\\nterm is the negative log likelihood function for θ under the distribution q(x|θ) eval-\\nuated using the training set. Thus we see that minimizing this Kullback-Leibler\\ndivergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function.\\nNow consider the joint distribution between two sets of variables x and y given\\nby p(x, y). If the sets of variables are independent, then their joint distribution will\\nfactorize into the product of their marginals p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). If the variables are\\nnot independent, we can gain some idea of whether they are ‘close’ to being indepen-\\ndent by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution\\nand the product of the marginals, given by\\nI[x, y]\\n≡\\nKL(p(x, y)∥p(x)p(y))\\n=\\n−\\n\\x06\\x06\\np(x, y) ln\\n\\x0fp(x)p(y)\\np(x, y)\\n\\x10\\ndx dy\\n(1.120)\\nwhich is called the mutual information between the variables x and y.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\ndamentally ill-posed, because there are inﬁnitely many probability distributions that\\ncould have given rise to the observed ﬁnite data set. Indeed, any distribution p(x)\\nthat is nonzero at each of the data points x1, . . . , xN is a potential candidate. The\\nissue of choosing an appropriate distribution relates to the problem of model selec-\\ntion that has already been encountered in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting in\\nChapter 1 and that is a central issue in pattern recognition.\\nWe begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete\\nrandom variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables.\\nThese are speciﬁc examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are\\ngoverned by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in\\nthe case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density\\nestimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters,\\ngiven an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose speciﬁc values\\nfor the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By\\ncontrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters\\nand then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution\\ngiven the observed data.\\nWe shall see that an important role is played by conjugate priors, that lead to\\nposterior distributions having the same functional form as the prior, and that there-\\nfore lead to a greatly simpliﬁed Bayesian analysis. For example, the conjugate prior\\nfor the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution,\\nwhile the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these\\ndistributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess\\na number of important properties, and which will be discussed in some detail.\\nOne limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a speciﬁc functional\\nform for the distribution, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular\\napplication. An alternative approach is given by nonparametric density estimation\\nmethods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data\\nset. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity\\nrather than the form of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three\\nnonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and\\nkernels.\\n2.1. Binary Variables\\nWe begin by considering a single binary random variable x ∈{0, 1}. For example,\\nx might describe the outcome of ﬂipping a coin, with x = 1 representing ‘heads’,\\nand x = 0 representing ‘tails’. We can imagine that this is a damaged coin so that\\nthe probability of landing heads is not necessarily the same as that of landing tails.\\nThe probability of x = 1 will be denoted by the parameter µ so that\\np(x = 1|µ) = µ\\n(2.1)'),\n",

Figure 2.3 illustrates\\none step in this process.\\nWe see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt\\na Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood\\nfunction and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d. data. Sequential methods make\\nuse of observations one at a time, or in small batches, and then discard them before\\nthe next observations are used. They can be used, for example, in real-time learning\\nscenarios where a steady stream of data is arriving, and predictions must be made\\nbefore all of the data is seen.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\nlarge data set. For a ﬁnite data set, the posterior mean for µ always lies between the\\nprior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for µ corresponding to the relative\\nfrequencies of events given by (2.7).\\nExercise 2.7\\nFrom Figure 2.2, we see that as the number of observations increases, so the\\nposterior distribution becomes more sharply peaked. This can also be seen from\\nthe result (2.16) for the variance of the beta distribution, in which we see that the\\nvariance goes to zero for a →∞or b →∞. In fact, we might wonder whether it is\\na general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the\\nuncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease.\\nTo address this, we can take a frequentist view of Bayesian learning and show\\nthat, on average, such a property does indeed hold. Consider a general Bayesian\\ninference problem for a parameter θ for which we have observed a data set D, de-\\nscribed by the joint distribution p(θ, D). The following result\\nExercise 2.8\\nEθ[θ] = ED [Eθ[θ|D]]\\n(2.21)\\nwhere\\nEθ[θ]\\n≡\\n\\x06\\np(θ)θ dθ\\n(2.22)\\nED[Eθ[θ|D]]\\n≡\\n\\x06 \\x0c\\x06\\nθp(θ|D) dθ\\n\\r\\np(D) dD\\n(2.23)\\nsays that the posterior mean of θ, averaged over the distribution generating the data,\\nis equal to the prior mean of θ. Similarly, we can show that\\nvarθ[θ] = ED [varθ[θ|D]] + varD [Eθ[θ|D]] .\\n(2.24)\\nThe term on the left-hand side of (2.24) is the prior variance of θ. On the right-\\nhand side, the ﬁrst term is the average posterior variance of θ, and the second term\\nmeasures the variance in the posterior mean of θ. Because this variance is a positive\\nquantity, this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of θ is smaller than\\nthe prior variance. The reduction in variance is greater if the variance in the posterior\\nmean is greater. Note, however, that this result only holds on average, and that for a\\nparticular observed data set it is possible for the posterior variance to be larger than\\nthe prior variance.\\n2.2. Multinomial Variables\\nBinary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible\\nvalues. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of K\\npossible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to\\nexpress such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient represen-\\ntation is the 1-of-K scheme in which the variable is represented by a K-dimensional\\nvector x in which one of the elements xk equals 1, and all remaining elements equal'),\n",

The Gaussian Distribution\\nThe Gaussian, also known as the normal distribution, is a widely used model for the\\ndistribution of continuous variables. In the case of a single variable x, the Gaussian\\ndistribution can be written in the form\\nN (x|µ, σ2) =\\n1\\n(2πσ2)1/2 exp\\n\\x01\\n−1\\n2σ2(x −µ)2\\n\\x02\\n(2.42)\\nwhere µ is the mean and σ2 is the variance.

For example, we have already seen that for\\nSection 1.6\\na single real variable, the distribution that maximizes the entropy is the Gaussian.\\nThis property applies also to the multivariate Gaussian.\\nExercise 2.14\\nAnother situation in which the Gaussian distribution arises is when we consider\\nthe sum of multiple random variables. The central limit theorem (due to Laplace)\\ntells us that, subject to certain mild conditions, the sum of a set of random variables,\\nwhich is of course itself a random variable, has a distribution that becomes increas-\\ningly Gaussian as the number of terms in the sum increases (Walker, 1969).

To\\nthe teacher’s amazement, Gauss\\narrived at the answer in a matter of moments by noting\\nthat the sum can be represented as 50 pairs (1 + 100,\\n2+99, etc.) each of which added to 101, giving the an-\\nswer 5,050. It is now believed that the problem which\\nwas actually set was of the same form but somewhat\\nharder in that the sequence had a larger starting value\\nand a larger increment. Gauss was a German math-\\nematician and scientist with a reputation for being a\\nhard-working perfectionist. One of his many contribu-\\ntions was to show that least squares can be derived\\nunder the assumption of normally distributed errors.\\nHe also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean\\ngeometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that vi-\\nolates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to dis-\\ncuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer\\nif it were seen that he believed in such a geometry.\\nAt one point, Gauss was asked to conduct a geodetic\\nsurvey of the state of Hanover, which led to his for-\\nmulation of the normal distribution, now also known\\nas the Gaussian. After his death, a study of his di-\\naries revealed that he had discovered several impor-\\ntant mathematical results years or even decades be-\\nfore they were published by others.'),\n",

One way to address this prob-\\nlem is to use restricted forms of the covariance matrix. If we consider covariance\\nmatrices that are diagonal, so that Σ = diag(σ2\\ni ), we then have a total of 2D inde-\\npendent parameters in the density model. The corresponding contours of constant\\ndensity are given by axis-aligned ellipsoids. We could further restrict the covariance\\nmatrix to be proportional to the identity matrix, Σ = σ2I, known as an isotropic co-\\nvariance, giving D + 1 independent parameters in the model and spherical surfaces\\nof constant density. The three possibilities of general, diagonal, and isotropic covari-\\nance matrices are illustrated in Figure 2.8. Unfortunately, whereas such approaches\\nlimit the number of degrees of freedom in the distribution and make inversion of the\\ncovariance matrix a much faster operation, they also greatly restrict the form of the\\nprobability density and limit its ability to capture interesting correlations in the data.\\nA further limitation of the Gaussian distribution is that it is intrinsically uni-\\nmodal (i.e., has a single maximum) and so is unable to provide a good approximation\\nto multimodal distributions. Thus the Gaussian distribution can be both too ﬂexible,\\nin the sense of having too many parameters, while also being too limited in the range\\nof distributions that it can adequately represent. We will see later that the introduc-\\ntion of latent variables, also called hidden variables or unobserved variables, allows\\nboth of these problems to be addressed. In particular, a rich family of multimodal\\ndistributions is obtained by introducing discrete latent variables leading to mixtures\\nof Gaussians, as discussed in Section 2.3.9. Similarly, the introduction of continuous\\nlatent variables, as described in Chapter 12, leads to models in which the number of\\nfree parameters can be controlled independently of the dimensionality D of the data\\nspace while still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data\\nset. Indeed, these two approaches can be combined and further extended to derive\\na very rich set of hierarchical models that can be adapted to a broad range of prac-\\ntical applications.

Because this distri-\\nbution is completely characterized by its mean and its covariance, our goal will be\\nto identify expressions for the mean and covariance of p(xa|xb) by inspection of\\n(2.70).\\nThis is an example of a rather common operation associated with Gaussian\\ndistributions, sometimes called ‘completing the square’, in which we are given a\\nquadratic form deﬁning the exponent terms in a Gaussian distribution, and we need\\nto determine the corresponding mean and covariance.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\n2.3.2\\nMarginal Gaussian distributions\\nWe have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi-\\ntional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of\\nthe marginal distribution given by\\np(xa) =\\n\\x06\\np(xa, xb) dxb\\n(2.83)\\nwhich, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this\\ndistribution efﬁciently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the\\njoint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal\\ndistribution p(xa).\\nThe quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par-\\ntitioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out\\nxb, this is most easily achieved by ﬁrst considering the terms involving xb and then\\ncompleting the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms\\nthat involve xb, we have\\n−1\\n2xT\\nb Λbbxb+xT\\nb m = −1\\n2(xb−Λ−1\\nbb m)TΛbb(xb−Λ−1\\nbb m)+1\\n2mTΛ−1\\nbb m (2.84)\\nwhere we have deﬁned\\nm = Λbbµb −Λba(xa −µa).\\n(2.85)\\nWe see that the dependence on xb has been cast into the standard quadratic form of a\\nGaussian distribution corresponding to the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (2.84),\\nplus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when\\nwe take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb\\nrequired by (2.83) will take the form\\n\\x06\\nexp\\n\\x0c\\n−1\\n2(xb −Λ−1\\nbb m)TΛbb(xb −Λ−1\\nbb m)\\n\\r\\ndxb.\\n(2.86)\\nThis integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor-\\nmalized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co-\\nefﬁcient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that\\nthis coefﬁcient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of\\nthe covariance matrix. Thus, by completing the square with respect to xb, we can\\nintegrate out xb and the only term remaining from the contributions on the left-hand\\nside of (2.84) that depends on xa is the last term on the right-hand side of (2.84) in\\nwhich m is given by (2.85).

One important case, which arises in practical applications, is that of periodic\\nvariables.\\nAn example of a periodic variable would be the wind direction at a particular\\ngeographical location. We might, for instance, measure values of wind direction on a\\nnumber of days and wish to summarize this using a parametric distribution. Another\\nexample is calendar time, where we may be interested in modelling quantities that\\nare believed to be periodic over 24 hours or over an annual cycle. Such quantities\\ncan conveniently be represented using an angular (polar) coordinate 0 ⩽θ < 2π.\\nWe might be tempted to treat periodic variables by choosing some direction\\nas the origin and then applying a conventional distribution such as the Gaussian.\\nSuch an approach, however, would give results that were strongly dependent on the\\narbitrary choice of origin. Suppose, for instance, that we have two observations at\\nθ1 = 1◦and θ2 = 359◦, and we model them using a standard univariate Gaussian\\ndistribution. If we choose the origin at 0◦, then the sample mean of this data set\\nwill be 180◦with standard deviation 179◦, whereas if we choose the origin at 180◦,\\nthen the mean will be 0◦and the standard deviation will be 1◦. We clearly need to\\ndevelop a special approach for the treatment of periodic variables.\\nLet us consider the problem of evaluating the mean of a set of observations\\nD = {θ1, . . . , θN} of a periodic variable. From now on, we shall assume that θ is\\nmeasured in radians. We have already seen that the simple average (θ1+· · ·+θN)/N\\nwill be strongly coordinate dependent. To ﬁnd an invariant measure of the mean, we\\nnote that the observations can be viewed as points on the unit circle and can therefore\\nbe described instead by two-dimensional unit vectors x1, . . . , xN where ∥xn∥= 1\\nfor n = 1, . . . , N, as illustrated in Figure 2.17. We can average the vectors {xn}'),\n",

The simplest approach is to use a histogram of\\nobservations in which the angular coordinate is divided into ﬁxed bins. This has the\\nvirtue of simplicity and ﬂexibility but also suffers from signiﬁcant limitations, as we\\nshall see when we discuss histogram methods in more detail in Section 2.5. Another\\napproach starts, like the von Mises distribution, from a Gaussian distribution over a\\nEuclidean space but now marginalizes onto the unit circle rather than conditioning\\n(Mardia and Jupp, 2000). However, this leads to more complex forms of distribution\\nand will not be discussed further. Finally, any valid distribution over the real axis\\n(such as a Gaussian) can be turned into a periodic distribution by mapping succes-\\nsive intervals of width 2π onto the periodic variable (0, 2π), which corresponds to\\n‘wrapping’ the real axis around unit circle. Again, the resulting distribution is more\\ncomplex to handle than the von Mises distribution.\\nOne limitation of the von Mises distribution is that it is unimodal. By forming\\nmixtures of von Mises distributions, we obtain a ﬂexible framework for modelling\\nperiodic variables that can handle multimodality. For an example of a machine learn-\\ning application that makes use of von Mises distributions, see Lawrence et al. (2002),\\nand for extensions to modelling conditional densities for regression problems, see\\nBishop and Nabney (1996).\\n2.3.9\\nMixtures of Gaussians\\nWhile the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suf-\\nfers from signiﬁcant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets. Consider\\nthe example shown in Figure 2.21. This is known as the ‘Old Faithful’ data set,\\nand comprises 272 measurements of the eruption of the Old Faithful geyser at Yel-\\nlowstone National Park in the USA.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\nany subsequent observations of data. In many cases, however, we may have little\\nidea of what form the distribution should take. We may then seek a form of prior\\ndistribution, called a noninformative prior, which is intended to have as little inﬂu-\\nence on the posterior distribution as possible (Jeffries, 1946; Box and Tao, 1973;\\nBernardo and Smith, 1994). This is sometimes referred to as ‘letting the data speak\\nfor themselves’.\\nIf we have a distribution p(x|λ) governed by a parameter λ, we might be tempted\\nto propose a prior distribution p(λ) = const as a suitable prior. If λ is a discrete\\nvariable with K states, this simply amounts to setting the prior probability of each\\nstate to 1/K. In the case of continuous parameters, however, there are two potential\\ndifﬁculties with this approach. The ﬁrst is that, if the domain of λ is unbounded,\\nthis prior distribution cannot be correctly normalized because the integral over λ\\ndiverges. Such priors are called improper. In practice, improper priors can often\\nbe used provided the corresponding posterior distribution is proper, i.e., that it can\\nbe correctly normalized. For instance, if we put a uniform prior distribution over\\nthe mean of a Gaussian, then the posterior distribution for the mean, once we have\\nobserved at least one data point, will be proper.\\nA second difﬁculty arises from the transformation behaviour of a probability\\ndensity under a nonlinear change of variables, given by (1.27). If a function h(λ)\\nis constant, and we change variables to λ = η2, then \\x01h(η) = h(η2) will also be\\nconstant. However, if we choose the density pλ(λ) to be constant, then the density\\nof η will be given, from (1.27), by\\npη(η) = pλ(λ)\\n\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\ndλ\\ndη\\n\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07 = pλ(η2)2η ∝η\\n(2.231)\\nand so the density over η will not be constant. This issue does not arise when we use\\nmaximum likelihood, because the likelihood function p(x|λ) is a simple function of\\nλ and so we are free to use any convenient parameterization. If, however, we are to\\nchoose a prior distribution that is constant, we must take care to use an appropriate\\nrepresentation for the parameters.\\nHere we consider two simple examples of noninformative priors (Berger, 1985).\\nFirst of all, if a density takes the form\\np(x|µ) = f(x −µ)\\n(2.232)\\nthen the parameter µ is known as a location parameter. This family of densities\\nexhibits translation invariance because if we shift x by a constant to give \\x01x = x + c,\\nthen\\np(\\x01x|\\x01µ) = f(\\x01x −\\x01µ)\\n(2.233)\\nwhere we have deﬁned \\x01µ = µ + c. Thus the density takes the same form in the\\nnew variable as in the original one, and so the density is independent of the choice\\nof origin. We would like to choose a prior distribution that reﬂects this translation\\ninvariance property, and so we choose a prior that assigns equal probability mass to'),\n",

Nonparametric Methods\\nThroughout this chapter, we have focussed on the use of probability distributions\\nhaving speciﬁc functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose\\nvalues are to be determined from a data set. This is called the parametric approach\\nto density modelling. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen\\ndensity might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can\\nresult in poor predictive performance. For instance, if the process that generates the\\ndata is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a\\nGaussian, which is necessarily unimodal.\\nIn this ﬁnal section, we consider some nonparametric approaches to density es-\\ntimation that make few assumptions about the form of the distribution. Here we shall\\nfocus mainly on simple frequentist methods. The reader should be aware, however,\\nthat nonparametric Bayesian methods are attracting increasing interest (Walker et al.,\\n1999; Neal, 2000; M¨uller and Quintana, 2004; Teh et al., 2006).\\nLet us start with a discussion of histogram methods for density estimation, which\\nwe have already encountered in the context of marginal and conditional distributions\\nin Figure 1.11 and in the context of the central limit theorem in Figure 2.6. Here we\\nexplore the properties of histogram density models in more detail, focussing on the\\ncase of a single continuous variable x. Standard histograms simply partition x into\\ndistinct bins of width ∆i and then count the number ni of observations of x falling\\nin bin i. In order to turn this count into a normalized probability density, we simply\\ndivide by the total number N of observations and by the width ∆i of the bins to\\nobtain probability values for each bin given by\\npi =\\nni\\nN∆i\\n(2.241)\\nfor which it is easily seen that \\x1c\\np(x) dx = 1. This gives a model for the density\\np(x) that is constant over the width of each bin, and often the bins are chosen to have\\nthe same width ∆i = ∆.'),\n",

We see that when ∆is very small (top ﬁgure), the resulting density model is very\\nspiky, with a lot of structure that is not present in the underlying distribution that\\ngenerated the data set. Conversely, if ∆is too large (bottom ﬁgure) then the result is\\na model that is too smooth and that consequently fails to capture the bimodal prop-\\nerty of the green curve.

In principle, a histogram density model is also dependent on\\nthe choice of edge location for the bins, though this is typically much less signiﬁcant\\nthan the value of ∆.\\nNote that the histogram method has the property (unlike the methods to be dis-\\ncussed shortly) that, once the histogram has been computed, the data set itself can\\nbe discarded, which can be advantageous if the data set is large. Also, the histogram\\napproach is easily applied if the data points are arriving sequentially.\\nIn practice, the histogram technique can be useful for obtaining a quick visual-\\nization of data in one or two dimensions but is unsuited to most density estimation\\napplications. One obvious problem is that the estimated density has discontinuities\\nthat are due to the bin edges rather than any property of the underlying distribution\\nthat generated the data. Another major limitation of the histogram approach is its\\nscaling with dimensionality. If we divide each variable in a D-dimensional space\\ninto M bins, then the total number of bins will be M D. This exponential scaling\\nwith D is an example of the curse of dimensionality.

Nonparametric Methods\\n123\\nWe can exploit the result (2.246) in two different ways. Either we can ﬁx K and\\ndetermine the value of V from the data, which gives rise to the K-nearest-neighbour\\ntechnique discussed shortly, or we can ﬁx V and determine K from the data, giv-\\ning rise to the kernel approach. It can be shown that both the K-nearest-neighbour\\ndensity estimator and the kernel density estimator converge to the true probability\\ndensity in the limit N →∞provided V shrinks suitably with N, and K grows with\\nN (Duda and Hart, 1973).\\nWe begin by discussing the kernel method in detail, and to start with we take\\nthe region R to be a small hypercube centred on the point x at which we wish to\\ndetermine the probability density. In order to count the number K of points falling\\nwithin this region, it is convenient to deﬁne the following function\\nk(u) =\\n\\x0c\\n1,\\n|ui| ⩽1/2,\\ni = 1, . . . , D,\\n0,\\notherwise\\n(2.247)\\nwhich represents a unit cube centred on the origin. The function k(u) is an example\\nof a kernel function, and in this context is also called a Parzen window. From (2.247),\\nthe quantity k((x −xn)/h) will be one if the data point xn lies inside a cube of side\\nh centred on x, and zero otherwise. The total number of data points lying inside this\\ncube will therefore be\\nK =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nk\\n\\x11x −xn\\nh\\n\\x12\\n.\\n(2.248)\\nSubstituting this expression into (2.246) then gives the following result for the esti-\\nmated density at x\\np(x) = 1\\nN\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n1\\nhD k\\n\\x11x −xn\\nh\\n\\x12\\n(2.249)\\nwhere we have used V = hD for the volume of a hypercube of side h in D di-\\nmensions. Using the symmetry of the function k(u), we can now re-interpret this\\nequation, not as a single cube centred on x but as the sum over N cubes centred on\\nthe N data points xn.\\nAs it stands, the kernel density estimator (2.249) will suffer from one of the same\\nproblems that the histogram method suffered from, namely the presence of artiﬁcial\\ndiscontinuities, in this case at the boundaries of the cubes. We can obtain a smoother\\ndensity model if we choose a smoother kernel function, and a common choice is the\\nGaussian, which gives rise to the following kernel density model\\np(x) = 1\\nN\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n1\\n(2πh2)1/2 exp\\n\\x0c\\n−∥x −xn∥2\\n2h2\\n\\r\\n(2.250)\\nwhere h represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. Thus our\\ndensity model is obtained by placing a Gaussian over each data point and then adding\\nup the contributions over the whole data set, and then dividing by N so that the den-\\nsity is correctly normalized.

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\nFigure 2.25\\nIllustration of the kernel density model\\n(2.250) applied to the same data set used\\nto demonstrate the histogram approach in\\nFigure 2.24.\\nWe see that h acts as a\\nsmoothing parameter and that if it is set\\ntoo small (top panel), the result is a very\\nnoisy density model, whereas if it is set\\ntoo large (bottom panel), then the bimodal\\nnature of the underlying distribution from\\nwhich the data is generated (shown by the\\ngreen curve) is washed out.

We see that, as expected,\\nthe parameter h plays the role of a smoothing parameter, and there is a trade-off\\nbetween sensitivity to noise at small h and over-smoothing at large h. Again, the\\noptimization of h is a problem in model complexity, analogous to the choice of bin\\nwidth in histogram density estimation, or the degree of the polynomial used in curve\\nﬁtting.\\nWe can choose any other kernel function k(u) in (2.249) subject to the condi-\\ntions\\nk(u)\\n⩾\\n0,\\n(2.251)\\n\\x06\\nk(u) du\\n=\\n1\\n(2.252)\\nwhich ensure that the resulting probability distribution is nonnegative everywhere\\nand integrates to one. The class of density model given by (2.249) is called a kernel\\ndensity estimator, or Parzen estimator. It has a great merit that there is no compu-\\ntation involved in the ‘training’ phase because this simply requires storage of the\\ntraining set. However, this is also one of its great weaknesses because the computa-\\ntional cost of evaluating the density grows linearly with the size of the data set.\\n2.5.2\\nNearest-neighbour methods\\nOne of the difﬁculties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the\\nparameter h governing the kernel width is ﬁxed for all kernels. In regions of high\\ndata density, a large value of h may lead to over-smoothing and a washing out of\\nstructure that might otherwise be extracted from the data. However, reducing h may\\nlead to noisy estimates elsewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus\\nthe optimal choice for h may be dependent on location within the data space. This\\nissue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation.\\nWe therefore return to our general result (2.246) for local density estimation,\\nand instead of ﬁxing V and determining the value of K from the data, we consider\\na ﬁxed value of K and use the data to ﬁnd an appropriate value for V .

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION\\nGiven a training data set comprising N observations {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N,\\ntogether with corresponding target values {tn}, the goal is to predict the value of t\\nfor a new value of x. In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly con-\\nstructing an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the\\npredictions for the corresponding values of t. More generally, from a probabilistic\\nperspective, we aim to model the predictive distribution p(t|x) because this expresses\\nour uncertainty about the value of t for each value of x. From this conditional dis-\\ntribution we can make predictions of t, for any new value of x, in such a way as to\\nminimize the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. As discussed in Sec-\\ntion 1.5.5, a common choice of loss function for real-valued variables is the squared\\nloss, for which the optimal solution is given by the conditional expectation of t.\\nAlthough linear models have signiﬁcant limitations as practical techniques for\\npattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimen-\\nsionality, they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more so-\\nphisticated models to be discussed in later chapters.\\n3.1. Linear Basis Function Models\\nThe simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of\\nthe input variables\\ny(x, w) = w0 + w1x1 + . . . + wDxD\\n(3.1)\\nwhere x = (x1, . . . , xD)T. This is often simply known as linear regression. The key\\nproperty of this model is that it is a linear function of the parameters w0, . . . , wD. It is\\nalso, however, a linear function of the input variables xi, and this imposes signiﬁcant\\nlimitations on the model. We therefore extend the class of models by considering\\nlinear combinations of ﬁxed nonlinear functions of the input variables, of the form\\ny(x, w) = w0 +\\nM−1\\n\\x02\\nj=1\\nwjφj(x)\\n(3.2)\\nwhere φj(x) are known as basis functions. By denoting the maximum value of the\\nindex j by M −1, the total number of parameters in this model will be M.\\nThe parameter w0 allows for any ﬁxed offset in the data and is sometimes called\\na bias parameter (not to be confused with ‘bias’ in a statistical sense). It is often\\nconvenient to deﬁne an additional dummy ‘basis function’ φ0(x) = 1 so that\\ny(x, w) =\\nM−1\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\nwjφj(x) = wTφ(x)\\n(3.3)\\nwhere w = (w0, . . . , wM−1)T and φ = (φ0, . . . , φM−1)T. In many practical ap-\\nplications of pattern recognition, we will apply some form of ﬁxed pre-processing,'),\n",

Linear Basis Function Models\\n139\\nor feature extraction, to the original data variables. If the original variables com-\\nprise the vector x, then the features can be expressed in terms of the basis functions\\n{φj(x)}.\\nBy using nonlinear basis functions, we allow the function y(x, w) to be a non-\\nlinear function of the input vector x. Functions of the form (3.2) are called linear\\nmodels, however, because this function is linear in w. It is this linearity in the pa-\\nrameters that will greatly simplify the analysis of this class of models. However, it\\nalso leads to some signiﬁcant limitations, as we discuss in Section 3.6.\\nThe example of polynomial regression considered in Chapter 1 is a particular\\nexample of this model in which there is a single input variable x, and the basis func-\\ntions take the form of powers of x so that φj(x) = xj. One limitation of polynomial\\nbasis functions is that they are global functions of the input variable, so that changes\\nin one region of input space affect all other regions. This can be resolved by dividing\\nthe input space up into regions and ﬁt a different polynomial in each region, leading\\nto spline functions (Hastie et al., 2001).\\nThere are many other possible choices for the basis functions, for example\\nφj(x) = exp\\n\\x0c\\n−(x −µj)2\\n2s2\\n\\r\\n(3.4)\\nwhere the µj govern the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the pa-\\nrameter s governs their spatial scale. These are usually referred to as ‘Gaussian’\\nbasis functions, although it should be noted that they are not required to have a prob-\\nabilistic interpretation, and in particular the normalization coefﬁcient is unimportant\\nbecause these basis functions will be multiplied by adaptive parameters wj.\\nAnother possibility is the sigmoidal basis function of the form\\nφj(x) = σ\\n\\x11x −µj\\ns\\n\\x12\\n(3.5)\\nwhere σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by\\nσ(a) =\\n1\\n1 + exp(−a).\\n(3.6)\\nEquivalently, we can use the ‘tanh’ function because this is related to the logistic\\nsigmoid by tanh(a) = 2σ(a) −1, and so a general linear combination of logistic\\nsigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of ‘tanh’ functions.\\nThese various choices of basis function are illustrated in Figure 3.1.\\nYet another possible choice of basis function is the Fourier basis, which leads to\\nan expansion in sinusoidal functions. Each basis function represents a speciﬁc fre-\\nquency and has inﬁnite spatial extent. By contrast, basis functions that are localized\\nto ﬁnite regions of input space necessarily comprise a spectrum of different spatial\\nfrequencies. In many signal processing applications, it is of interest to consider ba-\\nsis functions that are localized in both space and frequency, leading to a class of\\nfunctions known as wavelets. These are also deﬁned to be mutually orthogonal, to\\nsimplify their application. Wavelets are most applicable when the input values live'),\n",

We group the target variables {tn} into a column vector that we\\ndenote by t where the typeface is chosen to distinguish it from a single observation\\nof a multivariate target, which would be denoted t. Making the assumption that\\nthese data points are drawn independently from the distribution (3.8), we obtain the\\nfollowing expression for the likelihood function, which is a function of the adjustable\\nparameters w and β, in the form\\np(t|X, w, β) =\\nN\\n\\x0e\\nn=1\\nN(tn|wTφ(xn), β−1)\\n(3.10)\\nwhere we have used (3.3).

The least-squares\\nregression function is obtained by ﬁnding the or-\\nthogonal projection of the data vector t onto the\\nsubspace spanned by the basis functions φj(x)\\nin which each basis function is viewed as a vec-\\ntor ϕj of length N with elements φj(xn).\\nS\\nt\\ny\\nϕ1\\nϕ2\\nand so we see that the inverse of the noise precision is given by the residual variance\\nof the target values around the regression function.\\n3.1.2\\nGeometry of least squares\\nAt this point, it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of the\\nleast-squares solution. To do this we consider an N-dimensional space whose axes\\nare given by the tn, so that t = (t1, . . . , tN)T is a vector in this space. Each basis\\nfunction φj(xn), evaluated at the N data points, can also be represented as a vector in\\nthe same space, denoted by ϕj, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Note that ϕj corresponds\\nto the jth column of Φ, whereas φ(xn) corresponds to the nth row of Φ. If the\\nnumber M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points, then the\\nM vectors φj(xn) will span a linear subspace S of dimensionality M. We deﬁne\\ny to be an N-dimensional vector whose nth element is given by y(xn, w), where\\nn = 1, . . . , N. Because y is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors ϕj, it can\\nlive anywhere in the M-dimensional subspace. The sum-of-squares error (3.12) is\\nthen equal (up to a factor of 1/2) to the squared Euclidean distance between y and\\nt. Thus the least-squares solution for w corresponds to that choice of y that lies in\\nsubspace S and that is closest to t. Intuitively, from Figure 3.2, we anticipate that\\nthis solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection of t onto the subspace S. This\\nis indeed the case, as can easily be veriﬁed by noting that the solution for y is given\\nby ΦwML, and then conﬁrming that this takes the form of an orthogonal projection.\\nExercise 3.2\\nIn practice, a direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical difﬁ-\\nculties when ΦTΦ is close to singular. In particular, when two or more of the basis\\nvectors ϕj are co-linear, or nearly so, the resulting parameter values can have large\\nmagnitudes. Such near degeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real\\ndata sets. The resulting numerical difﬁculties can be addressed using the technique\\nof singular value decomposition, or SVD (Press et al., 1992; Bishop and Nabney,\\n2008). Note that the addition of a regularization term ensures that the matrix is non-\\nsingular, even in the presence of degeneracies.\\n3.1.3\\nSequential learning\\nBatch techniques, such as the maximum likelihood solution (3.15), which in-\\nvolve processing the entire training set in one go, can be computationally costly for\\nlarge data sets. As we have discussed in Chapter 1, if the data set is sufﬁciently large,\\nit may be worthwhile to use sequential algorithms, also known as on-line algorithms,'),\n",

If\\nthe error function comprises a sum over data points E = \\x05\\nn En, then after presen-\\ntation of pattern n, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the parameter\\nvector w using\\nw(τ+1) = w(τ) −η∇En\\n(3.22)\\nwhere τ denotes the iteration number, and η is a learning rate parameter.

The Bias-Variance Decomposition\\nSo far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the\\nform and number of basis functions are both ﬁxed.

However,\\nlimiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-ﬁtting has the side\\neffect of limiting the ﬂexibility of the model to capture interesting and important\\ntrends in the data. Although the introduction of regularization terms can control\\nover-ﬁtting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to\\ndetermine a suitable value for the regularization coefﬁcient λ. Seeking the solution\\nthat minimizes the regularized error function with respect to both the weight vector\\nw and the regularization coefﬁcient λ is clearly not the right approach since this\\nleads to the unregularized solution with λ = 0.\\nAs we have seen in earlier chapters, the phenomenon of over-ﬁtting is really an\\nunfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize\\nover parameters in a Bayesian setting. In this chapter, we shall consider the Bayesian\\nview of model complexity in some depth. Before doing so, however, it is instructive\\nto consider a frequentist viewpoint of the model complexity issue, known as the bias-\\nvariance trade-off. Although we shall introduce this concept in the context of linear\\nbasis function models, where it is easy to illustrate the ideas using simple examples,\\nthe discussion has more general applicability.\\nIn Section 1.5.5, when we discussed decision theory for regression problems,\\nwe considered various loss functions each of which leads to a corresponding optimal\\nprediction once we are given the conditional distribution p(t|x).

We might use more sophisticated\\ntechniques than least squares, for example regularization or a fully Bayesian ap-\\nproach, to determine the conditional distribution p(t|x). These can all be combined\\nwith the squared loss function for the purpose of making predictions.\\nWe showed in Section 1.5.5 that the expected squared loss can be written in the\\nform\\nE[L] =\\n\\x06\\n{y(x) −h(x)}2 p(x) dx +\\n\\x06\\n{h(x) −t}2p(x, t) dx dt.\\n(3.37)\\nRecall that the second term, which is independent of y(x), arises from the intrinsic\\nnoise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss.\\nThe ﬁrst term depends on our choice for the function y(x), and we will seek a so-\\nlution for y(x) which makes this term a minimum. Because it is nonnegative, the\\nsmallest that we can hope to make this term is zero. If we had an unlimited supply of\\ndata (and unlimited computational resources), we could in principle ﬁnd the regres-\\nsion function h(x) to any desired degree of accuracy, and this would represent the\\noptimal choice for y(x). However, in practice we have a data set D containing only\\na ﬁnite number N of data points, and consequently we do not know the regression\\nfunction h(x) exactly.\\nIf we model the h(x) using a parametric function y(x, w) governed by a pa-\\nrameter vector w, then from a Bayesian perspective the uncertainty in our model is\\nexpressed through a posterior distribution over w. A frequentist treatment, however,\\ninvolves making a point estimate of w based on the data set D, and tries instead\\nto interpret the uncertainty of this estimate through the following thought experi-\\nment. Suppose we had a large number of data sets each of size N and each drawn\\nindependently from the distribution p(t, x). For any given data set D, we can run\\nour learning algorithm and obtain a prediction function y(x; D).

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION\\ndata set leading to large variance. Conversely, a large value of λ pulls the weight\\nparameters towards zero leading to large bias.\\nAlthough the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting in-\\nsights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of lim-\\nited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages\\nwith respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single\\nobserved data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given\\nsize, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which\\nof course would reduce the level of over-ﬁtting for a given model complexity.\\nGiven these limitations, we turn in the next section to a Bayesian treatment of\\nlinear basis function models, which not only provides powerful insights into the\\nissues of over-ﬁtting but which also leads to practical techniques for addressing the\\nquestion model complexity.\\n3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression\\nIn our discussion of maximum likelihood for setting the parameters of a linear re-\\ngression model, we have seen that the effective model complexity, governed by the\\nnumber of basis functions, needs to be controlled according to the size of the data\\nset. Adding a regularization term to the log likelihood function means the effective\\nmodel complexity can then be controlled by the value of the regularization coefﬁ-\\ncient, although the choice of the number and form of the basis functions is of course\\nstill important in determining the overall behaviour of the model.\\nThis leaves the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the par-\\nticular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood func-\\ntion, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-ﬁtting. In-\\ndependent hold-out data can be used to determine model complexity, as discussed\\nin Section 1.3, but this can be both computationally expensive and wasteful of valu-\\nable data. We therefore turn to a Bayesian treatment of linear regression, which will\\navoid the over-ﬁtting problem of maximum likelihood, and which will also lead to\\nautomatic methods of determining model complexity using the training data alone.\\nAgain, for simplicity we will focus on the case of a single target variable t. Ex-\\ntension to multiple target variables is straightforward and follows the discussion of\\nSection 3.1.5.\\n3.3.1\\nParameter distribution\\nWe begin our discussion of the Bayesian treatment of linear regression by in-\\ntroducing a prior probability distribution over the model parameters w. For the mo-\\nment, we shall treat the noise precision parameter β as a known constant. First note\\nthat the likelihood function p(t|w) deﬁned by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic\\nfunction of w. The corresponding conjugate prior is therefore given by a Gaussian\\ndistribution of the form\\np(w) = N(w|m0, S0)\\n(3.48)\\nhaving mean m0 and covariance S0.'),\n",

Due to the choice of a conjugate Gaus-\\nsian prior distribution, the posterior will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate this\\ndistribution by the usual procedure of completing the square in the exponential, and\\nthen ﬁnding the normalization coefﬁcient using the standard result for a normalized\\nGaussian.

LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION\\na linear model of the form y(x, w) = w0 + w1x. Because this has just two adap-\\ntive parameters, we can plot the prior and posterior distributions directly in parameter\\nspace. We generate synthetic data from the function f(x, a) = a0+a1x with param-\\neter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 by ﬁrst choosing values of xn from the uniform\\ndistribution U(x|−1, 1), then evaluating f(xn, a), and ﬁnally adding Gaussian noise\\nwith standard deviation of 0.2 to obtain the target values tn. Our goal is to recover\\nthe values of a0 and a1 from such data, and we will explore the dependence on the\\nsize of the data set. We assume here that the noise variance is known and hence we\\nset the precision parameter to its true value β = (1/0.2)2 = 25. Similarly, we ﬁx\\nthe parameter α to 2.0. We shall shortly discuss strategies for determining α and\\nβ from the training data. Figure 3.7 shows the results of Bayesian learning in this\\nmodel as the size of the data set is increased and demonstrates the sequential nature\\nof Bayesian learning in which the current posterior distribution forms the prior when\\na new data point is observed. It is worth taking time to study this ﬁgure in detail as\\nit illustrates several important aspects of Bayesian inference. The ﬁrst row of this\\nﬁgure corresponds to the situation before any data points are observed and shows a\\nplot of the prior distribution in w space together with six samples of the function\\ny(x, w) in which the values of w are drawn from the prior. In the second row, we\\nsee the situation after observing a single data point. The location (x, t) of the data\\npoint is shown by a blue circle in the right-hand column. In the left-hand column is a\\nplot of the likelihood function p(t|x, w) for this data point as a function of w. Note\\nthat the likelihood function provides a soft constraint that the line must pass close to\\nthe data point, where close is determined by the noise precision β. For comparison,\\nthe true parameter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 used to generate the data set\\nare shown by a white cross in the plots in the left column of Figure 3.7. When we\\nmultiply this likelihood function by the prior from the top row, and normalize, we\\nobtain the posterior distribution shown in the middle plot on the second row. Sam-\\nples of the regression function y(x, w) obtained by drawing samples of w from this\\nposterior distribution are shown in the right-hand plot. Note that these sample lines\\nall pass close to the data point. The third row of this ﬁgure shows the effect of ob-\\nserving a second data point, again shown by a blue circle in the plot in the right-hand\\ncolumn. The corresponding likelihood function for this second data point alone is\\nshown in the left plot. When we multiply this likelihood function by the posterior\\ndistribution from the second row, we obtain the posterior distribution shown in the\\nmiddle plot of the third row. Note that this is exactly the same posterior distribution\\nas would be obtained by combining the original prior with the likelihood function\\nfor the two data points. This posterior has now been inﬂuenced by two data points,\\nand because two points are sufﬁcient to deﬁne a line this already gives a relatively\\ncompact posterior distribution. Samples from this posterior distribution give rise to\\nthe functions shown in red in the third column, and we see that these functions pass\\nclose to both of the data points. The fourth row shows the effect of observing a total\\nof 20 data points. The left-hand plot shows the likelihood function for the 20th data\\npoint alone, and the middle plot shows the resulting posterior distribution that has\\nnow absorbed information from all 20 observations.

Thus the mean of the predictive distribution at a point\\nx is given by a linear combination of the training set target variables tn, so that we\\ncan write\\ny(x, mN) =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nk(x, xn)tn\\n(3.61)\\nwhere the function\\nk(x, x′) = βφ(x)TSNφ(x′)\\n(3.62)\\nis known as the smoother matrix or the equivalent kernel. Regression functions, such\\nas this, which make predictions by taking linear combinations of the training set\\ntarget values are known as linear smoothers. Note that the equivalent kernel depends\\non the input values xn from the data set because these appear in the deﬁnition of\\nSN. The equivalent kernel is illustrated for the case of Gaussian basis functions in\\nFigure 3.10 in which the kernel functions k(x, x′) have been plotted as a function of\\nx′ for three different values of x. We see that they are localized around x, and so the\\nmean of the predictive distribution at x, given by y(x, mN), is obtained by forming\\na weighted combination of the target values in which data points close to x are given\\nhigher weight than points further removed from x. Intuitively, it seems reasonable\\nthat we should weight local evidence more strongly than distant evidence. Note that\\nthis localization property holds not only for the localized Gaussian basis functions\\nbut also for the nonlocal polynomial and sigmoidal basis functions, as illustrated in\\nFigure 3.11.'),\n",

Bayesian Model Comparison\\nIn Chapter 1, we highlighted the problem of over-ﬁtting as well as the use of cross-\\nvalidation as a technique for setting the values of regularization parameters or for\\nchoosing between alternative models. Here we consider the problem of model se-\\nlection from a Bayesian perspective. In this section, our discussion will be very\\ngeneral, and then in Section 3.5 we shall see how these ideas can be applied to the\\ndetermination of regularization parameters in linear regression.\\nAs we shall see, the over-ﬁtting associated with maximum likelihood can be\\navoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters in-\\nstead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared di-\\nrectly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all\\navailable data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each\\nmodel associated with cross-validation. It also allows multiple complexity parame-\\nters to be determined simultaneously as part of the training process. For example,\\nin Chapter 7 we shall introduce the relevance vector machine, which is a Bayesian\\nmodel having one complexity parameter for every training data point.\\nThe Bayesian view of model comparison simply involves the use of probabilities\\nto represent uncertainty in the choice of model, along with a consistent application\\nof the sum and product rules of probability. Suppose we wish to compare a set of L\\nmodels {Mi} where i = 1, . . . , L. Here a model refers to a probability distribution\\nover the observed data D. In the case of the polynomial curve-ﬁtting problem, the\\ndistribution is deﬁned over the set of target values t, while the set of input values X\\nis assumed to be known.

The model\\nevidence is sometimes also called the marginal likelihood because it can be viewed\\nas a likelihood function over the space of models, in which the parameters have been\\nmarginalized out. The ratio of model evidences p(D|Mi)/p(D|Mj) for two models\\nis known as a Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995).\\nOnce we know the posterior distribution over models, the predictive distribution\\nis given, from the sum and product rules, by\\np(t|x, D) =\\nL\\n\\x02\\ni=1\\np(t|x, Mi, D)p(Mi|D).\\n(3.67)\\nThis is an example of a mixture distribution in which the overall predictive distribu-\\ntion is obtained by averaging the predictive distributions p(t|x, Mi, D) of individual\\nmodels, weighted by the posterior probabilities p(Mi|D) of those models. For in-\\nstance, if we have two models that are a-posteriori equally likely and one predicts\\na narrow distribution around t = a while the other predicts a narrow distribution\\naround t = b, the overall predictive distribution will be a bimodal distribution with\\nmodes at t = a and t = b, not a single model at t = (a + b)/2.\\nA simple approximation to model averaging is to use the single most probable\\nmodel alone to make predictions.

Indeed,\\nthe evidence is not deﬁned if the prior is improper, as can be seen by noting that\\nan improper prior has an arbitrary scaling factor (in other words, the normalization\\ncoefﬁcient is not deﬁned because the distribution cannot be normalized). If we con-\\nsider a proper prior and then take a suitable limit in order to obtain an improper prior\\n(for example, a Gaussian prior in which we take the limit of inﬁnite variance) then\\nthe evidence will go to zero, as can be seen from (3.70) and Figure 3.12.

The Evidence Approximation\\nIn a fully Bayesian treatment of the linear basis function model, we would intro-\\nduce prior distributions over the hyperparameters α and β and make predictions by\\nmarginalizing with respect to these hyperparameters as well as with respect to the\\nparameters w. However, although we can integrate analytically over either w or\\nover the hyperparameters, the complete marginalization over all of these variables\\nis analytically intractable. Here we discuss an approximation in which we set the\\nhyperparameters to speciﬁc values determined by maximizing the marginal likeli-\\nhood function obtained by ﬁrst integrating over the parameters w. This framework\\nis known in the statistics literature as empirical Bayes (Bernardo and Smith, 1994;\\nGelman et al., 2004), or type 2 maximum likelihood (Berger, 1985), or generalized\\nmaximum likelihood (Wahba, 1975), and in the machine learning literature is also\\ncalled the evidence approximation (Gull, 1989; MacKay, 1992a).\\nIf we introduce hyperpriors over α and β, the predictive distribution is obtained\\nby marginalizing over w, α and β so that\\np(t|t) =\\n\\x06\\x06\\x06\\np(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β)p(α, β|t) dw dα dβ\\n(3.74)\\nwhere p(t|w, β) is given by (3.8) and p(w|t, α, β) is given by (3.49) with mN and\\nSN deﬁned by (3.53) and (3.54) respectively.

We shall\\nproceed by evaluating the marginal likelihood for the linear basis function model and\\nthen ﬁnding its maxima. This will allow us to determine values for these hyperpa-\\nrameters from the training data alone, without recourse to cross-validation. Recall\\nthat the ratio α/β is analogous to a regularization parameter.\\nAs an aside it is worth noting that, if we deﬁne conjugate (Gamma) prior distri-\\nbutions over α and β, then the marginalization over these hyperparameters in (3.74)\\ncan be performed analytically to give a Student’s t-distribution over w (see Sec-\\ntion 2.3.7). Although the resulting integral over w is no longer analytically tractable,\\nit might be thought that approximating this integral, for example using the Laplace\\napproximation discussed (Section 4.4) which is based on a local Gaussian approxi-\\nmation centred on the mode of the posterior distribution, might provide a practical\\nalternative to the evidence framework (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). However, the\\nintegrand as a function of w typically has a strongly skewed mode so that the Laplace\\napproximation fails to capture the bulk of the probability mass, leading to poorer re-\\nsults than those obtained by maximizing the evidence (MacKay, 1999).\\nReturning to the evidence framework, we note that there are two approaches that\\nwe can take to the maximization of the log evidence. We can evaluate the evidence\\nfunction analytically and then set its derivative equal to zero to obtain re-estimation\\nequations for α and β, which we shall do in Section 3.5.2.

Going to the M = 1 polynomial greatly improves the data ﬁt, and\\nhence the evidence is signiﬁcantly higher.

Indeed, Figure 1.5 shows that the residual data error is\\nreduced only slightly in going from M = 1 to M = 2. Because this richer model\\nsuffers a greater complexity penalty, the evidence actually falls in going from M = 1\\nto M = 2. When we go to M = 3 we obtain a signiﬁcant further improvement in\\ndata ﬁt, as seen in Figure 1.4, and so the evidence is increased again, giving the\\nhighest overall evidence for any of the polynomials. Further increases in the value\\nof M produce only small improvements in the ﬁt to the data but suffer increasing\\ncomplexity penalty, leading overall to a decrease in the evidence values. Looking\\nagain at Figure 1.5, we see that the generalization error is roughly constant between\\nM = 3 and M = 8, and it would be difﬁcult to choose between these models on\\nthe basis of this plot alone.

To see this, consider the contours of the like-\\nlihood function and the prior as illustrated in Figure 3.15. Here we have implicitly\\ntransformed to a rotated set of axes in parameter space aligned with the eigenvec-\\ntors ui deﬁned in (3.87). Contours of the likelihood function are then axis-aligned\\nellipses. The eigenvalues λi measure the curvature of the likelihood function, and\\nso in Figure 3.15 the eigenvalue λ1 is small compared with λ2 (because a smaller\\ncurvature corresponds to a greater elongation of the contours of the likelihood func-\\ntion). Because βΦTΦ is a positive deﬁnite matrix, it will have positive eigenvalues,\\nand so the ratio λi/(λi + α) will lie between 0 and 1. Consequently, the quantity γ\\ndeﬁned by (3.91) will lie in the range 0 ⩽γ ⩽M. For directions in which λi ≫α,\\nthe corresponding parameter wi will be close to its maximum likelihood value, and\\nthe ratio λi/(λi + α) will be close to 1. Such parameters are called well determined\\nbecause their values are tightly constrained by the data. Conversely, for directions\\nin which λi ≪α, the corresponding parameters wi will be close to zero, as will the\\nratios λi/(λi +α). These are directions in which the likelihood function is relatively\\ninsensitive to the parameter value and so the parameter has been set to a small value\\nby the prior. The quantity γ deﬁned by (3.91) therefore measures the effective total\\nnumber of well determined parameters.\\nWe can obtain some insight into the result (3.95) for re-estimating β by com-\\nparing it with the corresponding maximum likelihood result given by (3.21). Both\\nof these formulae express the variance (the inverse precision) as an average of the\\nsquared differences between the targets and the model predictions.

Neural network models,\\nwhich use adaptive basis functions having sigmoidal nonlinearities, can adapt the\\nparameters so that the regions of input space over which the basis functions vary\\ncorresponds to the data manifold.

LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION\\nways of using target values to represent class labels. For probabilistic models, the\\nmost convenient, in the case of two-class problems, is the binary representation in\\nwhich there is a single target variable t ∈{0, 1} such that t = 1 represents class C1\\nand t = 0 represents class C2. We can interpret the value of t as the probability that\\nthe class is C1, with the values of probability taking only the extreme values of 0 and\\n1. For K > 2 classes, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme in which t is\\na vector of length K such that if the class is Cj, then all elements tk of t are zero\\nexcept element tj, which takes the value 1. For instance, if we have K = 5 classes,\\nthen a pattern from class 2 would be given the target vector\\nt = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T.\\n(4.1)\\nAgain, we can interpret the value of tk as the probability that the class is Ck. For\\nnonprobabilistic models, alternative choices of target variable representation will\\nsometimes prove convenient.\\nIn Chapter 1, we identiﬁed three distinct approaches to the classiﬁcation prob-\\nlem. The simplest involves constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns\\neach vector x to a speciﬁc class. A more powerful approach, however, models the\\nconditional probability distribution p(Ck|x) in an inference stage, and then subse-\\nquently uses this distribution to make optimal decisions. By separating inference\\nand decision, we gain numerous beneﬁts, as discussed in Section 1.5.4. There are\\ntwo different approaches to determining the conditional probabilities p(Ck|x). One\\ntechnique is to model them directly, for example by representing them as parametric\\nmodels and then optimizing the parameters using a training set. Alternatively, we\\ncan adopt a generative approach in which we model the class-conditional densities\\ngiven by p(x|Ck), together with the prior probabilities p(Ck) for the classes, and then\\nwe compute the required posterior probabilities using Bayes’ theorem\\np(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)\\np(x)\\n.\\n(4.2)\\nWe shall discuss examples of all three approaches in this chapter.\\nIn the linear regression models considered in Chapter 3, the model prediction\\ny(x, w) was given by a linear function of the parameters w. In the simplest case,\\nthe model is also linear in the input variables and therefore takes the form y(x) =\\nwTx+w0, so that y is a real number. For classiﬁcation problems, however, we wish\\nto predict discrete class labels, or more generally posterior probabilities that lie in\\nthe range (0, 1). To achieve this, we consider a generalization of this model in which\\nwe transform the linear function of w using a nonlinear function f( · ) so that\\ny(x) = f \\nwTx + w0\\n\\x0b\\n.\\n(4.3)\\nIn the machine learning literature f( · ) is known as an activation function, whereas\\nits inverse is called a link function in the statistics literature. The decision surfaces\\ncorrespond to y(x) = constant, so that wTx + w0 = constant and hence the deci-\\nsion surfaces are linear functions of x, even if the function f(·) is nonlinear. For this\\nreason, the class of models described by (4.3) are called generalized linear models'),\n",

We begin by consider-\\ning classiﬁcation directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall\\nﬁnd it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency\\nwith later chapters.\\n4.1. Discriminant Functions\\nA discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K\\nclasses, denoted Ck. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to linear discriminants,\\nnamely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the dis-\\ncussion, we consider ﬁrst the case of two classes and then investigate the extension\\nto K > 2 classes.\\n4.1.1\\nTwo classes\\nThe simplest representation of a linear discriminant function is obtained by tak-\\ning a linear function of the input vector so that\\ny(x) = wTx + w0\\n(4.4)\\nwhere w is called a weight vector, and w0 is a bias (not to be confused with bias in\\nthe statistical sense). The negative of the bias is sometimes called a threshold. An\\ninput vector x is assigned to class C1 if y(x) ⩾0 and to class C2 otherwise. The cor-\\nresponding decision boundary is therefore deﬁned by the relation y(x) = 0, which\\ncorresponds to a (D −1)-dimensional hyperplane within the D-dimensional input\\nspace. Consider two points xA and xB both of which lie on the decision surface.\\nBecause y(xA) = y(xB) = 0, we have wT(xA −xB) = 0 and hence the vector w is\\northogonal to every vector lying within the decision surface, and so w determines the\\norientation of the decision surface. Similarly, if x is a point on the decision surface,\\nthen y(x) = 0, and so the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is\\ngiven by\\nwTx\\n∥w∥= −w0\\n∥w∥.\\n(4.5)\\nWe therefore see that the bias parameter w0 determines the location of the decision\\nsurface. These properties are illustrated for the case of D = 2 in Figure 4.1.\\nFurthermore, we note that the value of y(x) gives a signed measure of the per-\\npendicular distance r of the point x from the decision surface.

A natural choice of error func-\\ntion would be the total number of misclassiﬁed patterns. However, this does not lead\\nto a simple learning algorithm because the error is a piecewise constant function\\nof w, with discontinuities wherever a change in w causes the decision boundary to\\nmove across one of the data points. Methods based on changing w using the gradi-\\nent of the error function cannot then be applied, because the gradient is zero almost\\neverywhere.\\nWe therefore consider an alternative error function known as the perceptron cri-\\nterion. To derive this, we note that we are seeking a weight vector w such that\\npatterns xn in class C1 will have wTφ(xn) > 0, whereas patterns xn in class C2\\nhave wTφ(xn) < 0. Using the t ∈{−1, +1} target coding scheme it follows that\\nwe would like all patterns to satisfy wTφ(xn)tn > 0. The perceptron criterion\\nassociates zero error with any pattern that is correctly classiﬁed, whereas for a mis-\\nclassiﬁed pattern xn it tries to minimize the quantity −wTφ(xn)tn. The perceptron\\ncriterion is therefore given by\\nEP(w) = −\\n\\x02\\nn∈M\\nwTφntn\\n(4.54)\\nFrank Rosenblatt\\n1928–1969\\nRosenblatt’s perceptron played an\\nimportant role in the history of ma-\\nchine learning. Initially, Rosenblatt\\nsimulated the perceptron on an IBM\\n704 computer at Cornell in 1957,\\nbut by the early 1960s he had built\\nspecial-purpose hardware that provided a direct, par-\\nallel implementation of perceptron learning. Many of\\nhis ideas were encapsulated in “Principles of Neuro-\\ndynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mech-\\nanisms” published in 1962.\\nRosenblatt’s work was\\ncriticized by Marvin Minksy, whose objections were\\npublished in the book “Perceptrons”, co-authored with\\nSeymour Papert.\\nThis book was widely misinter-\\npreted at the time as showing that neural networks\\nwere fatally ﬂawed and could only learn solutions for\\nlinearly separable problems.\\nIn fact, it only proved\\nsuch limitations in the case of single-layer networks\\nsuch as the perceptron and merely conjectured (in-\\ncorrectly) that they applied to more general network\\nmodels.

LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION\\nwhere M denotes the set of all misclassiﬁed patterns. The contribution to the error\\nassociated with a particular misclassiﬁed pattern is a linear function of w in regions\\nof w space where the pattern is misclassiﬁed and zero in regions where it is correctly\\nclassiﬁed. The total error function is therefore piecewise linear.\\nWe now apply the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this error function.\\nSection 3.1.3\\nThe change in the weight vector w is then given by\\nw(τ+1) = w(τ) −η∇EP(w) = w(τ) + ηφntn\\n(4.55)\\nwhere η is the learning rate parameter and τ is an integer that indexes the steps of\\nthe algorithm. Because the perceptron function y(x, w) is unchanged if we multiply\\nw by a constant, we can set the learning rate parameter η equal to 1 without of\\ngenerality. Note that, as the weight vector evolves during training, the set of patterns\\nthat are misclassiﬁed will change.\\nThe perceptron learning algorithm has a simple interpretation, as follows. We\\ncycle through the training patterns in turn, and for each pattern xn we evaluate the\\nperceptron function (4.52). If the pattern is correctly classiﬁed, then the weight\\nvector remains unchanged, whereas if it is incorrectly classiﬁed, then for class C1\\nwe add the vector φ(xn) onto the current estimate of weight vector w while for\\nclass C2 we subtract the vector φ(xn) from w. The perceptron learning algorithm is\\nillustrated in Figure 4.7.\\nIf we consider the effect of a single update in the perceptron learning algorithm,\\nwe see that the contribution to the error from a misclassiﬁed pattern will be reduced\\nbecause from (4.55) we have\\n−w(τ+1)Tφntn = −w(τ)Tφntn −(φntn)Tφntn < −w(τ)Tφntn\\n(4.56)\\nwhere we have set η = 1, and made use of ∥φntn∥2 > 0. Of course, this does\\nnot imply that the contribution to the error function from the other misclassiﬁed\\npatterns will have been reduced. Furthermore, the change in weight vector may have\\ncaused some previously correctly classiﬁed patterns to become misclassiﬁed. Thus\\nthe perceptron learning rule is not guaranteed to reduce the total error function at\\neach stage.\\nHowever, the perceptron convergence theorem states that if there exists an ex-\\nact solution (in other words, if the training data set is linearly separable), then the\\nperceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd an exact solution in a ﬁnite num-\\nber of steps. Proofs of this theorem can be found for example in Rosenblatt (1962),\\nBlock (1962), Nilsson (1965), Minsky and Papert (1969), Hertz et al. (1991), and\\nBishop (1995a). Note, however, that the number of steps required to achieve con-\\nvergence could still be substantial, and in practice, until convergence is achieved,\\nwe will not be able to distinguish between a nonseparable problem and one that is\\nsimply slow to converge.\\nEven when the data set is linearly separable, there may be many solutions, and\\nwhich one is found will depend on the initialization of the parameters and on the or-\\nder of presentation of the data points. Furthermore, for data sets that are not linearly\\nseparable, the perceptron learning algorithm will never converge.'),\n",

The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph,\\nwhich allowed different conﬁgurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to\\ndemonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern\\ndigital computer.

The most\\nimportant limitation, however, arises from the fact that (in common with all of the\\nmodels discussed in this chapter and the previous one) it is based on linear com-\\nbinations of ﬁxed basis functions.

Because such points can lie a long way to the wrong side\\nof the ideal decision boundary, they can seriously distort the classiﬁer. Note that the\\nlogistic and probit regression models behave differently in this respect because the\\ntails of the logistic sigmoid decay asymptotically like exp(−x) for x →∞, whereas\\nfor the probit activation function they decay like exp(−x2), and so the probit model\\ncan be signiﬁcantly more sensitive to outliers.\\nHowever, both the logistic and the probit models assume the data is correctly\\nlabelled. The effect of mislabelling is easily incorporated into a probabilistic model\\nby introducing a probability ϵ that the target value t has been ﬂipped to the wrong\\nvalue (Opper and Winther, 2000a), leading to a target value distribution for data point\\nx of the form\\np(t|x)\\n=\\n(1 −ϵ)σ(x) + ϵ(1 −σ(x))\\n=\\nϵ + (1 −2ϵ)σ(x)\\n(4.117)\\nwhere σ(x) is the activation function with input vector x.

The most successful\\nmodel of this type in the context of pattern recognition is the feed-forward neural\\nnetwork, also known as the multilayer perceptron, discussed in this chapter.

The price to\\nbe paid for this compactness, as with the relevance vector machine, is that the like-\\nlihood function, which forms the basis for network training, is no longer a convex\\nfunction of the model parameters. In practice, however, it is often worth investing\\nsubstantial computational resources during the training phase in order to obtain a\\ncompact model that is fast at processing new data.\\nThe term ‘neural network’ has its origins in attempts to ﬁnd mathematical rep-\\nresentations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts,\\n1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986). Indeed,\\nit has been used very broadly to cover a wide range of different models, many of\\nwhich have been the subject of exaggerated claims regarding their biological plau-\\nsibility. From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition, how-\\never, biological realism would impose entirely unnecessary constraints. Our focus in\\nthis chapter is therefore on neural networks as efﬁcient models for statistical pattern\\nrecognition. In particular, we shall restrict our attention to the speciﬁc class of neu-\\nral networks that have proven to be of greatest practical value, namely the multilayer\\nperceptron.\\nWe begin by considering the functional form of the network model, including\\nthe speciﬁc parameterization of the basis functions, and we then discuss the prob-\\nlem of determining the network parameters within a maximum likelihood frame-\\nwork, which involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This requires\\nthe evaluation of derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the net-\\nwork parameters, and we shall see how these can be obtained efﬁciently using the\\ntechnique of error backpropagation. We shall also show how the backpropagation\\nframework can be extended to allow other derivatives to be evaluated, such as the\\nJacobian and Hessian matrices. Next we discuss various approaches to regulariza-\\ntion of neural network training and the relationships between them. We also consider\\nsome extensions to the neural network model, and in particular we describe a gen-\\neral framework for modelling conditional probability distributions known as mixture\\ndensity networks. Finally, we discuss the use of Bayesian treatments of neural net-\\nworks. Additional background on neural network models can be found in Bishop\\n(1995a).'),\n",

Neural networks use\\nbasis functions that follow the same form as (5.1), so that each basis function is itself\\na nonlinear function of a linear combination of the inputs, where the coefﬁcients in\\nthe linear combination are adaptive parameters.\\nThis leads to the basic neural network model, which can be described a series\\nof functional transformations.

We shall see later how to give a probabilistic\\ninterpretation to a neural network.\\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, the bias parameters in (5.2) can be absorbed into\\nthe set of weight parameters by deﬁning an additional input variable x0 whose value\\nis clamped at x0 = 1, so that (5.2) takes the form\\naj =\\nD\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nw(1)\\nji xi.\\n(5.8)\\nWe can similarly absorb the second-layer biases into the second-layer weights, so\\nthat the overall network function becomes\\nyk(x, w) = σ\\n\\x16 M\\n\\x02\\nj=0\\nw(2)\\nkj h\\n\\x16 D\\n\\x02\\ni=0\\nw(1)\\nji xi\\n\\x17\\x17\\n.\\n(5.9)\\nAs can be seen from Figure 5.1, the neural network model comprises two stages\\nof processing, each of which resembles the perceptron model of Section 4.1.7, and\\nfor this reason the neural network is also known as the multilayer perceptron, or\\nMLP. A key difference compared to the perceptron, however, is that the neural net-\\nwork uses continuous sigmoidal nonlinearities in the hidden units, whereas the per-\\nceptron uses step-function nonlinearities. This means that the neural network func-\\ntion is differentiable with respect to the network parameters, and this property will\\nplay a central role in network training.\\nIf the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are taken to be\\nlinear, then for any such network we can always ﬁnd an equivalent network without\\nhidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of successive linear\\ntransformations is itself a linear transformation. However, if the number of hidden\\nunits is smaller than either the number of input or output units, then the transforma-\\ntions that the network can generate are not the most general possible linear trans-\\nformations from inputs to outputs because information is lost in the dimensionality\\nreduction at the hidden units. In Section 12.4.2, we show that networks of linear\\nunits give rise to principal component analysis. In general, however, there is little\\ninterest in multilayer networks of linear units.\\nThe network architecture shown in Figure 5.1 is the most commonly used one\\nin practice. However, it is easily generalized, for instance by considering additional\\nlayers of processing each consisting of a weighted linear combination of the form\\n(5.4) followed by an element-wise transformation using a nonlinear activation func-\\ntion. Note that there is some confusion in the literature regarding the terminology\\nfor counting the number of layers in such networks. Thus the network in Figure 5.1\\nmay be described as a 3-layer network (which counts the number of layers of units,\\nand treats the inputs as units) or sometimes as a single-hidden-layer network (which\\ncounts the number of layers of hidden units). We recommend a terminology in which\\nFigure 5.1 is called a two-layer network, because it is the number of layers of adap-\\ntive weights that is important for determining the network properties.\\nAnother generalization of the network architecture is to include skip-layer con-\\nnections, each of which is associated with a corresponding adaptive parameter.

In\\nprinciple, a network with sigmoidal hidden units can always mimic skip layer con-\\nnections (for bounded input values) by using a sufﬁciently small ﬁrst-layer weight\\nthat, over its operating range, the hidden unit is effectively linear, and then com-\\npensating with a large weight value from the hidden unit to the output. In practice,\\nhowever, it may be advantageous to include skip-layer connections explicitly.\\nFurthermore, the network can be sparse, with not all possible connections within\\na layer being present. We shall see an example of a sparse network architecture when\\nwe consider convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6.\\nBecause there is a direct correspondence between a network diagram and its\\nmathematical function, we can develop more general network mappings by con-\\nsidering more complex network diagrams. However, these must be restricted to a\\nfeed-forward architecture, in other words to one having no closed directed cycles, to\\nensure that the outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs. This is illustrated\\nwith a simple example in Figure 5.2. Each (hidden or output) unit in such a network\\ncomputes a function given by\\nzk = h\\n\\x16\\x02\\nj\\nwkjzj\\n\\x17\\n(5.10)\\nwhere the sum runs over all units that send connections to unit k (and a bias param-\\neter is included in the summation). For a given set of values applied to the inputs of\\nthe network, successive application of (5.10) allows the activations of all units in the\\nnetwork to be evaluated including those of the output units.\\nThe approximation properties of feed-forward networks have been widely stud-\\nied (Funahashi, 1989; Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Stinchecombe and White,\\n1989; Cotter, 1990; Ito, 1991; Hornik, 1991; Kreinovich, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and\\nfound to be very general. Neural networks are therefore said to be universal ap-\\nproximators. For example, a two-layer network with linear outputs can uniformly\\napproximate any continuous function on a compact input domain to arbitrary accu-\\nracy provided the network has a sufﬁciently large number of hidden units. This result\\nholds for a wide range of hidden unit activation functions, but excluding polynomi-\\nals. Although such theorems are reassuring, the key problem is how to ﬁnd suitable\\nparameter values given a set of training data, and in later sections of this chapter we'),\n",

We have already seen\\nmany advantages of using probabilistic predictions in Section 1.5.4. Here it will also\\nprovide us with a clearer motivation both for the choice of output unit nonlinearity\\nand the choice of error function.\\nWe start by discussing regression problems, and for the moment we consider\\na single target variable t that can take any real value. Following the discussions\\nin Section 1.2.5 and 3.1, we assume that t has a Gaussian distribution with an x-\\ndependent mean, which is given by the output of the neural network, so that\\np(t|x, w) = N\\n\\nt|y(x, w), β−1\\x0b\\n(5.12)\\nwhere β is the precision (inverse variance) of the Gaussian noise. Of course this\\nis a somewhat restrictive assumption, and in Section 5.6 we shall see how to extend\\nthis approach to allow for more general conditional distributions. For the conditional\\ndistribution given by (5.12), it is sufﬁcient to take the output unit activation function\\nto be the identity, because such a network can approximate any continuous function\\nfrom x to y. Given a data set of N independent, identically distributed observations\\nX = {x1, . . . , xN}, along with corresponding target values t = {t1, . . . , tN}, we\\ncan construct the corresponding likelihood function\\np(t|X, w, β) =\\nN\\n\\x0e\\nn=1\\np(tn|xn, w, β).\\nTaking the negative logarithm, we obtain the error function\\nβ\\n2\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n{y(xn, w) −tn}2 −N\\n2 ln β + N\\n2 ln(2π)\\n(5.13)\\nwhich can be used to learn the parameters w and β.

Points at which the gradient vanishes are called stationary\\npoints, and may be further classiﬁed into minima, maxima, and saddle points.\\nOur goal is to ﬁnd a vector w such that E(w) takes its smallest value. How-\\never, the error function typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights\\nand bias parameters, and so there will be many points in weight space at which the\\ngradient vanishes (or is numerically very small).

Error Backpropagation\\n241\\nThis update is repeated by cycling through the data either in sequence or by selecting\\npoints at random with replacement. There are of course intermediate scenarios in\\nwhich the updates are based on batches of data points.\\nOne advantage of on-line methods compared to batch methods is that the former\\nhandle redundancy in the data much more efﬁciently. To see, this consider an ex-\\ntreme example in which we take a data set and double its size by duplicating every\\ndata point. Note that this simply multiplies the error function by a factor of 2 and so\\nis equivalent to using the original error function. Batch methods will require double\\nthe computational effort to evaluate the batch error function gradient, whereas on-\\nline methods will be unaffected. Another property of on-line gradient descent is the\\npossibility of escaping from local minima, since a stationary point with respect to\\nthe error function for the whole data set will generally not be a stationary point for\\neach data point individually.\\nNonlinear optimization algorithms, and their practical application to neural net-\\nwork training, are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008).\\n5.3. Error Backpropagation\\nOur goal in this section is to ﬁnd an efﬁcient technique for evaluating the gradient\\nof an error function E(w) for a feed-forward neural network. We shall see that\\nthis can be achieved using a local message passing scheme in which information is\\nsent alternately forwards and backwards through the network and is known as error\\nbackpropagation, or sometimes simply as backprop.\\nIt should be noted that the term backpropagation is used in the neural com-\\nputing literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multilayer\\nperceptron architecture is sometimes called a backpropagation network. The term\\nbackpropagation is also used to describe the training of a multilayer perceptron us-\\ning gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In order to clarify\\nthe terminology, it is useful to consider the nature of the training process more care-\\nfully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure for minimization of an\\nerror function, with adjustments to the weights being made in a sequence of steps. At\\neach such step, we can distinguish between two distinct stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the\\nderivatives of the error function with respect to the weights must be evaluated. As\\nwe shall see, the important contribution of the backpropagation technique is in pro-\\nviding a computationally efﬁcient method for evaluating such derivatives. Because\\nit is at this stage that errors are propagated backwards through the network, we shall\\nuse the term backpropagation speciﬁcally to describe the evaluation of derivatives.\\nIn the second stage, the derivatives are then used to compute the adjustments to be\\nmade to the weights. The simplest such technique, and the one originally considered\\nby Rumelhart et al. (1986), involves gradient descent. It is important to recognize\\nthat the two stages are distinct. Thus, the ﬁrst stage, namely the propagation of er-\\nrors backwards through the network in order to evaluate derivatives, can be applied\\nto many other kinds of network and not just the multilayer perceptron. It can also be\\napplied to error functions other that just the simple sum-of-squares, and to the eval-'),\n",

To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer operations\\nrequired to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the total number\\nW of weights and biases in the network. A single evaluation of the error function\\n(for a given input pattern) would require O(W) operations, for sufﬁciently large W.\\nThis follows from the fact that, except for a network with very sparse connections,\\nthe number of weights is typically much greater than the number of units, and so the\\nbulk of the computational effort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluat-\\ning the sums in (5.48), with the evaluation of the activation functions representing a\\nsmall overhead. Each term in the sum in (5.48) requires one multiplication and one\\naddition, leading to an overall computational cost that is O(W).\\nAn alternative approach to backpropagation for computing the derivatives of the\\nerror function is to use ﬁnite differences. This can be done by perturbing each weight\\nin turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression\\n∂En\\n∂wji\\n= En(wji + ϵ) −En(wji)\\nϵ\\n+ O(ϵ)\\n(5.68)\\nwhere ϵ ≪1. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the approximation to the\\nderivatives can be improved by making ϵ smaller, until numerical roundoff problems\\narise. The accuracy of the ﬁnite differences method can be improved signiﬁcantly\\nby using symmetrical central differences of the form\\n∂En\\n∂wji\\n= En(wji + ϵ) −En(wji −ϵ)\\n2ϵ\\n+ O(ϵ2).\\n(5.69)\\nIn this case, the O(ϵ) corrections cancel, as can be veriﬁed by Taylor expansion on\\nExercise 5.14\\nthe right-hand side of (5.69), and so the residual corrections are O(ϵ2). The number\\nof computational steps is, however, roughly doubled compared with (5.68).\\nThe main problem with numerical differentiation is that the highly desirable\\nO(W) scaling has been lost.

As we shall see, there are efﬁcient methods for evaluating the Hessian\\nwhose scaling is indeed O(W 2).\\n5.4.1\\nDiagonal approximation\\nSome of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the\\ninverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason, there has\\nbeen some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, in other words\\none that simply replaces the off-diagonal elements with zeros, because its inverse is\\ntrivial to evaluate. Again, we shall consider an error function that consists of a sum\\nof terms, one for each pattern in the data set, so that E = \\x05\\nn En. The Hessian can\\nthen be obtained by considering one pattern at a time, and then summing the results\\nover all patterns. From (5.48), the diagonal elements of the Hessian, for pattern n,\\ncan be written\\n∂2En\\n∂w2\\nji\\n= ∂2En\\n∂a2\\nj\\nz2\\ni .\\n(5.79)\\nUsing (5.48) and (5.49), the second derivatives on the right-hand side of (5.79) can\\nbe found recursively using the chain rule of differential calculus to give a backprop-\\nagation equation of the form\\n∂2En\\n∂a2\\nj\\n= h′(aj)2 \\x02\\nk\\n\\x02\\nk′\\nwkjwk′j\\n∂2En\\n∂ak∂ak′ + h′′(aj)\\n\\x02\\nk\\nwkj\\n∂En\\n∂ak\\n.\\n(5.80)\\nIf we now neglect off-diagonal elements in the second-derivative terms, we obtain\\n(Becker and Le Cun, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990)\\n∂2En\\n∂a2\\nj\\n= h′(aj)2 \\x02\\nk\\nw2\\nkj\\n∂2En\\n∂a2\\nk\\n+ h′′(aj)\\n\\x02\\nk\\nwkj\\n∂En\\n∂ak\\n.\\n(5.81)\\nNote that the number of computational steps required to evaluate this approximation\\nis O(W), where W is the total number of weight and bias parameters in the network,\\ncompared with O(W 2) for the full Hessian.\\nRicotti et al.

Note that this no longer has O(W) scaling. The major\\nproblem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice the Hessian is\\ntypically found to be strongly nondiagonal, and so these approximations, which are\\ndriven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated with care.'),\n",

NEURAL NETWORKS\\n5.4.3\\nInverse Hessian\\nWe can use the outer-product approximation to develop a computationally ef-\\nﬁcient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian (Hassibi and Stork,\\n1993). First we write the outer-product approximation in matrix notation as\\nHN =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nbnbT\\nn\\n(5.86)\\nwhere bn ≡∇wan is the contribution to the gradient of the output unit activation\\narising from data point n. We now derive a sequential procedure for building up the\\nHessian by including data points one at a time. Suppose we have already obtained\\nthe inverse Hessian using the ﬁrst L data points. By separating off the contribution\\nfrom data point L + 1, we obtain\\nHL+1 = HL + bL+1bT\\nL+1.\\n(5.87)\\nIn order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian, we now consider the matrix identity\\n\\nM + vvT\\x0b−1 = M−1 −(M−1v)\\n\\nvTM−1\\x0b\\n1 + vTM−1v\\n(5.88)\\nwhere I is the unit matrix, which is simply a special case of the Woodbury identity\\n(C.7). If we now identify HL with M and bL+1 with v, we obtain\\nH−1\\nL+1 = H−1\\nL −H−1\\nL bL+1bT\\nL+1H−1\\nL\\n1 + bT\\nL+1H−1\\nL bL+1\\n.\\n(5.89)\\nIn this way, data points are sequentially absorbed until L+1 = N and the whole data\\nset has been processed. This result therefore represents a procedure for evaluating\\nthe inverse of the Hessian using a single pass through the data set. The initial matrix\\nH0 is chosen to be αI, where α is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually\\nﬁnds the inverse of H + αI. The results are not particularly sensitive to the precise\\nvalue of α. Extension of this algorithm to networks having more than one output is\\nstraightforward.\\nExercise 5.21\\nWe note here that the Hessian matrix can sometimes be calculated indirectly as\\npart of the network training algorithm. In particular, quasi-Newton nonlinear opti-\\nmization algorithms gradually build up an approximation to the inverse of the Hes-\\nsian during training. Such algorithms are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney\\n(2008).\\n5.4.4\\nFinite differences\\nAs in the case of the ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, we can ﬁnd the second\\nderivatives by using ﬁnite differences, with accuracy limited by numerical precision.\\nIf we perturb each possible pair of weights in turn, we obtain\\n∂2E\\n∂wji∂wlk\\n=\\n1\\n4ϵ2 {E(wji + ϵ, wlk + ϵ) −E(wji + ϵ, wlk −ϵ)\\n−E(wji −ϵ, wlk + ϵ) + E(wji −ϵ, wlk −ϵ)} + O(ϵ2).\\n(5.90)'),\n",

It therefore has\\npoor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful as a check on the soft-\\nware implementation of backpropagation methods.\\nA more efﬁcient version of numerical differentiation can be found by applying\\ncentral differences to the ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, which are themselves\\ncalculated using backpropagation.

The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net-\\nwork of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back-\\npropagation used to evaluate ﬁrst derivatives, which shares many of its desirable\\nfeatures including computational efﬁciency (Bishop, 1991; Bishop, 1992). It can be\\napplied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of\\nthe network outputs and to networks having arbitrary differentiable activation func-\\ntions. The number of computational steps needed to evaluate the Hessian scales\\nlike O(W 2). Similar algorithms have also been considered by Buntine and Weigend\\n(1993).\\nHere we consider the speciﬁc case of a network having two layers of weights,\\nfor which the required equations are easily derived.

Figure 5.9 shows an example of the\\neffect of different values of M for the sinusoidal regression problem.\\nThe generalization error, however, is not a simple function of M due to the\\npresence of local minima in the error function, as illustrated in Figure 5.10. Here\\nwe see the effect of choosing multiple random initializations for the weight vector\\nfor a range of values of M. The overall best validation set performance in this\\ncase occurred for a particular solution having M = 8. In practice, one approach to\\nchoosing M is in fact to plot a graph of the kind shown in Figure 5.10 and then to\\nchoose the speciﬁc solution having the smallest validation set error.\\nThere are, however, other ways to control the complexity of a neural network\\nmodel in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. From our discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting\\nin Chapter 1, we see that an alternative approach is to choose a relatively large value\\nfor M and then to control complexity by the addition of a regularization term to the\\nerror function.

Training can therefore be stopped at the point\\nof smallest error with respect to the validation data set, as indicated in Figure 5.12,\\nin order to obtain a network having good generalization performance.\\nThe behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualitatively\\nin terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network, in which this\\nnumber starts out small and then to grows during the training process, corresponding\\nto a steady increase in the effective complexity of the model.

For example, in the classiﬁcation of objects in two-dimensional images, such\\nas handwritten digits, a particular object should be assigned the same classiﬁcation\\nirrespective of its position within the image (translation invariance) or of its size\\n(scale invariance). Such transformations produce signiﬁcant changes in the raw\\ndata, expressed in terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image, and\\nyet should give rise to the same output from the classiﬁcation system. Similarly\\nin speech recognition, small levels of nonlinear warping along the time axis, which\\npreserve temporal ordering, should not change the interpretation of the signal.\\nIf sufﬁciently large numbers of training patterns are available, then an adaptive\\nmodel such as a neural network can learn the invariance, at least approximately. This\\ninvolves including within the training set a sufﬁciently large number of examples of\\nthe effects of the various transformations. Thus, for translation invariance in an im-\\nage, the training set should include examples of objects at many different positions.\\nThis approach may be impractical, however, if the number of training examples\\nis limited, or if there are several invariants (because the number of combinations of\\ntransformations grows exponentially with the number of such transformations). We\\ntherefore seek alternative approaches for encouraging an adaptive model to exhibit\\nthe required invariances. These can broadly be divided into four categories:\\n1. The training set is augmented using replicas of the training patterns, trans-\\nformed according to the desired invariances.

Regularization in Neural Networks\\n267\\nWe can further simplify this regularization term as follows. In Section 1.5.5 we\\nsaw that the function that minimizes the sum-of-squares error is given by the condi-\\ntional average E[t|x] of the target values t. From (5.131) we see that the regularized\\nerror will equal the unregularized sum-of-squares plus terms which are O(ξ), and so\\nthe network function that minimizes the total error will have the form\\ny(x) = E[t|x] + O(ξ).\\n(5.133)\\nThus, to leading order in ξ, the ﬁrst term in the regularizer vanishes and we are left\\nwith\\nΩ= 1\\n2\\n\\x06 \\nτ T ∇y(x)\\x0b2 p(x) dx\\n(5.134)\\nwhich is equivalent to the tangent propagation regularizer (5.128).\\nIf we consider the special case in which the transformation of the inputs simply\\nconsists of the addition of random noise, so that x →x + ξ, then the regularizer\\ntakes the form\\nExercise 5.27\\nΩ= 1\\n2\\n\\x06\\n∥∇y(x)∥2 p(x) dx\\n(5.135)\\nwhich is known as Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop,\\n1995b). Derivatives of this regularizer with respect to the network weights can be\\nfound using an extended backpropagation algorithm (Bishop, 1993). We see that, for\\nsmall noise amplitudes, Tikhonov regularization is related to the addition of random\\nnoise to the inputs, which has been shown to improve generalization in appropriate\\ncircumstances (Sietsma and Dow, 1991).\\n5.5.6\\nConvolutional networks\\nAnother approach to creating models that are invariant to certain transformation\\nof the inputs is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neural net-\\nwork. This is the basis for the convolutional neural network (Le Cun et al., 1989;\\nLeCun et al., 1998), which has been widely applied to image data.\\nConsider the speciﬁc task of recognizing handwritten digits. Each input image\\ncomprises a set of pixel intensity values, and the desired output is a posterior proba-\\nbility distribution over the ten digit classes. We know that the identity of the digit is\\ninvariant under translations and scaling as well as (small) rotations. Furthermore, the\\nnetwork must also exhibit invariance to more subtle transformations such as elastic\\ndeformations of the kind illustrated in Figure 5.14. One simple approach would be to\\ntreat the image as the input to a fully connected network, such as the kind shown in\\nFigure 5.1. Given a sufﬁciently large training set, such a network could in principle\\nyield a good solution to this problem and would learn the appropriate invariances by\\nexample.\\nHowever, this approach ignores a key property of images, which is that nearby\\npixels are more strongly correlated than more distant pixels. Many of the modern\\napproaches to computer vision exploit this property by extracting local features that\\ndepend only on small subregions of the image. Information from such features can\\nthen be merged in later stages of processing in order to detect higher-order features'),\n",

Because we\\nwill typically need to detect multiple features in order to build an effective model,\\nthere will generally be multiple feature maps in the convolutional layer, each having\\nits own set of weight and bias parameters.\\nThe outputs of the convolutional units form the inputs to the subsampling layer\\nof the network. For each feature map in the convolutional layer, there is a plane of\\nunits in the subsampling layer and each unit takes inputs from a small receptive ﬁeld\\nin the corresponding feature map of the convolutional layer. These units perform\\nsubsampling. For instance, each subsampling unit might take inputs from a 2 × 2\\nunit region in the corresponding feature map and would compute the average of\\nthose inputs, multiplied by an adaptive weight with the addition of an adaptive bias\\nparameter, and then transformed using a sigmoidal nonlinear activation function.\\nThe receptive ﬁelds are chosen to be contiguous and nonoverlapping so that there\\nare half the number of rows and columns in the subsampling layer compared with\\nthe convolutional layer. In this way, the response of a unit in the subsampling layer\\nwill be relatively insensitive to small shifts of the image in the corresponding regions\\nof the input space.\\nIn a practical architecture, there may be several pairs of convolutional and sub-\\nsampling layers. At each stage there is a larger degree of invariance to input trans-\\nformations compared to the previous layer. There may be several feature maps in a\\ngiven convolutional layer for each plane of units in the previous subsampling layer,\\nso that the gradual reduction in spatial resolution is then compensated by an increas-\\ning number of features.

This involves a slight modiﬁcation\\nof the usual backpropagation algorithm to ensure that the shared-weight constraints\\nare satisﬁed. Due to the use of local receptive ﬁelds, the number of weights in\\nExercise 5.28\\nthe network is smaller than if the network were fully connected. Furthermore, the\\nnumber of independent parameters to be learned from the data is much smaller still,\\ndue to the substantial numbers of constraints on the weights.\\n5.5.7\\nSoft weight sharing\\nOne way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number\\nof weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is the\\ntechnique of weight sharing that was discussed in Section 5.5.6 as a way of building\\ntranslation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. It is only appli-\\ncable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the constraints can be\\nspeciﬁed in advance. Here we consider a form of soft weight sharing (Nowlan and\\nHinton, 1992) in which the hard constraint of equal weights is replaced by a form\\nof regularization in which groups of weights are encouraged to have similar values.\\nFurthermore, the division of weights into groups, the mean weight value for each\\ngroup, and the spread of values within the groups are all determined as part of the\\nlearning process.'),\n",

NEURAL NETWORKS\\nRecall that the simple weight decay regularizer, given in (5.112), can be viewed\\nas the negative log of a Gaussian prior distribution over the weights. We can encour-\\nage the weight values to form several groups, rather than just one group, by consid-\\nering instead a probability distribution that is a mixture of Gaussians. The centres\\nSection 2.3.9\\nand variances of the Gaussian components, as well as the mixing coefﬁcients, will be\\nconsidered as adjustable parameters to be determined as part of the learning process.\\nThus, we have a probability density of the form\\np(w) =\\n\\x0e\\ni\\np(wi)\\n(5.136)\\nwhere\\np(wi) =\\nM\\n\\x02\\nj=1\\nπjN(wi|µj, σ2\\nj)\\n(5.137)\\nand πj are the mixing coefﬁcients. Taking the negative logarithm then leads to a\\nregularization function of the form\\nΩ(w) = −\\n\\x02\\ni\\nln\\n\\x16 M\\n\\x02\\nj=1\\nπjN(wi|µj, σ2\\nj)\\n\\x17\\n.\\n(5.138)\\nThe total error function is then given by\\n\\x04E(w) = E(w) + λΩ(w)\\n(5.139)\\nwhere λ is the regularization coefﬁcient. This error is minimized both with respect\\nto the weights wi and with respect to the parameters {πj, µj, σj} of the mixture\\nmodel. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture model could\\nbe determined by using the EM algorithm discussed in Chapter 9. However, the dis-\\ntribution of weights is itself evolving during the learning process, and so to avoid nu-\\nmerical instability, a joint optimization is performed simultaneously over the weights\\nand the mixture-model parameters. This can be done using a standard optimization\\nalgorithm such as conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton methods.\\nIn order to minimize the total error function, it is necessary to be able to evaluate\\nits derivatives with respect to the various adjustable parameters. To do this it is con-\\nvenient to regard the {πj} as prior probabilities and to introduce the corresponding\\nposterior probabilities which, following (2.192), are given by Bayes’ theorem in the\\nform\\nγj(w) =\\nπjN(w|µj, σ2\\nj)\\n\\x05\\nk πkN(w|µk, σ2\\nk).\\n(5.140)\\nThe derivatives of the total error function with respect to the weights are then given\\nby\\nExercise 5.29\\n∂\\x04E\\n∂wi\\n= ∂E\\n∂wi\\n+ λ\\n\\x02\\nj\\nγj(wi)(wi −µj)\\nσ2\\nj\\n.\\n(5.141)'),\n",

Mixture Density Networks\\nThe goal of supervised learning is to model a conditional distribution p(t|x), which\\nfor many simple regression problems is chosen to be Gaussian. However, practical\\nmachine learning problems can often have signiﬁcantly non-Gaussian distributions.\\nThese can arise, for example, with inverse problems in which the distribution can be\\nmultimodal, in which case the Gaussian assumption can lead to very poor predic-\\ntions.\\nAs a simple example of an inverse problem, consider the kinematics of a robot\\narm, as illustrated in Figure 5.18. The forward problem involves ﬁnding the end ef-\\nExercise 5.33\\nfector position given the joint angles and has a unique solution. However, in practice\\nwe wish to move the end effector of the robot to a speciﬁc position, and to do this we\\nmust set appropriate joint angles. We therefore need to solve the inverse problem,\\nwhich has two solutions as seen in Figure 5.18.\\nForward problems often corresponds to causality in a physical system and gen-\\nerally have a unique solution. For instance, a speciﬁc pattern of symptoms in the\\nhuman body may be caused by the presence of a particular disease. In pattern recog-\\nnition, however, we typically have to solve an inverse problem, such as trying to\\npredict the presence of a disease given a set of symptoms. If the forward problem\\ninvolves a many-to-one mapping, then the inverse problem will have multiple solu-\\ntions. For instance, several different diseases may result in the same symptoms.\\nIn the robotics example, the kinematics is deﬁned by geometrical equations, and\\nthe multimodality is readily apparent. However, in many machine learning problems\\nthe presence of multimodality, particularly in problems involving spaces of high di-\\nmensionality, can be less obvious. For tutorial purposes, however, we shall consider\\na simple toy problem for which we can easily visualize the multimodality. Data for\\nthis problem is generated by sampling a variable x uniformly over the interval (0, 1),\\nto give a set of values {xn}, and the corresponding target values tn are obtained'),\n",

We have also specialized to the case of isotropic co-\\nvariances for the components, although the mixture density network can readily be\\nextended to allow for general covariance matrices by representing the covariances\\nusing a Cholesky factorization (Williams, 1996). Even with isotropic components,\\nthe conditional distribution p(t|x) does not assume factorization with respect to the\\ncomponents of t (in contrast to the standard sum-of-squares regression model) as a\\nconsequence of the mixture distribution.\\nWe now take the various parameters of the mixture model, namely the mixing\\ncoefﬁcients πk(x), the means µk(x), and the variances σ2\\nk(x), to be governed by'),\n",

KERNEL METHODS\\nclosest example from the training set. These are examples of memory-based methods\\nthat involve storing the entire training set in order to make predictions for future data\\npoints. They typically require a metric to be deﬁned that measures the similarity of\\nany two vectors in input space, and are generally fast to ‘train’ but slow at making\\npredictions for test data points.\\nMany linear parametric models can be re-cast into an equivalent ‘dual represen-\\ntation’ in which the predictions are also based on linear combinations of a kernel\\nfunction evaluated at the training data points. As we shall see, for models which are\\nbased on a ﬁxed nonlinear feature space mapping φ(x), the kernel function is given\\nby the relation\\nk(x, x′) = φ(x)Tφ(x′).\\n(6.1)\\nFrom this deﬁnition, we see that the kernel is a symmetric function of its arguments\\nso that k(x, x′) = k(x′, x). The kernel concept was introduced into the ﬁeld of pat-\\ntern recognition by Aizerman et al. (1964) in the context of the method of potential\\nfunctions, so-called because of an analogy with electrostatics. Although neglected\\nfor many years, it was re-introduced into machine learning in the context of large-\\nmargin classiﬁers by Boser et al. (1992) giving rise to the technique of support\\nvector machines. Since then, there has been considerable interest in this topic, both\\nChapter 7\\nin terms of theory and applications. One of the most signiﬁcant developments has\\nbeen the extension of kernels to handle symbolic objects, thereby greatly expanding\\nthe range of problems that can be addressed.\\nThe simplest example of a kernel function is obtained by considering the identity\\nmapping for the feature space in (6.1) so that φ(x) = x, in which case k(x, x′) =\\nxTx′. We shall refer to this as the linear kernel.\\nThe concept of a kernel formulated as an inner product in a feature space allows\\nus to build interesting extensions of many well-known algorithms by making use of\\nthe kernel trick, also known as kernel substitution. The general idea is that, if we have\\nan algorithm formulated in such a way that the input vector x enters only in the form\\nof scalar products, then we can replace that scalar product with some other choice of\\nkernel. For instance, the technique of kernel substitution can be applied to principal\\ncomponent analysis in order to develop a nonlinear variant of PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al.,\\nSection 12.3\\n1998). Other examples of kernel substitution include nearest-neighbour classiﬁers\\nand the kernel Fisher discriminant (Mika et al., 1999; Roth and Steinhage, 2000;\\nBaudat and Anouar, 2000).\\nThere are numerous forms of kernel functions in common use, and we shall en-\\ncounter several examples in this chapter. Many have the property of being a function\\nonly of the difference between the arguments, so that k(x, x′) = k(x −x′), which\\nare known as stationary kernels because they are invariant to translations in input\\nspace. A further specialization involves homogeneous kernels, also known as ra-\\ndial basis functions, which depend only on the magnitude of the distance (typically\\nSection 6.3\\nEuclidean) between the arguments so that k(x, x′) = k(∥x −x′∥).\\nFor recent textbooks on kernel methods, see Sch¨olkopf and Smola (2002), Her-\\nbrich (2002), and Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004).'),\n",

If we set the gradient of J(w) with respect to w equal to zero, we see\\nthat the solution for w takes the form of a linear combination of the vectors φ(xn),\\nwith coefﬁcients that are functions of w, of the form\\nw = −1\\nλ\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n\\x1a\\nwTφ(xn) −tn\\n\\x1b\\nφ(xn) =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nanφ(xn) = ΦTa\\n(6.3)\\nwhere Φ is the design matrix, whose nth row is given by φ(xn)T. Here the vector\\na = (a1, . . . , aN)T, and we have deﬁned\\nan = −1\\nλ\\n\\x1a\\nwTφ(xn) −tn\\n\\x1b\\n.\\n(6.4)\\nInstead of working with the parameter vector w, we can now reformulate the least-\\nsquares algorithm in terms of the parameter vector a, giving rise to a dual represen-\\ntation. If we substitute w = ΦTa into J(w), we obtain\\nJ(a) = 1\\n2aTΦΦTΦΦTa −aTΦΦTt + 1\\n2tTt + λ\\n2 aTΦΦTa\\n(6.5)\\nwhere t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We now deﬁne the Gram matrix K = ΦΦT, which is an\\nN × N symmetric matrix with elements\\nKnm = φ(xn)Tφ(xm) = k(xn, xm)\\n(6.6)\\nwhere we have introduced the kernel function k(x, x′) deﬁned by (6.1). In terms of\\nthe Gram matrix, the sum-of-squares error function can be written as\\nJ(a) = 1\\n2aTKKa −aTKt + 1\\n2tTt + λ\\n2 aTKa.\\n(6.7)\\nSetting the gradient of J(a) with respect to a to zero, we obtain the following solu-\\ntion\\na = (K + λIN)−1 t.\\n(6.8)'),\n",

KERNEL METHODS\\nIf we substitute this back into the linear regression model, we obtain the following\\nprediction for a new input x\\ny(x) = wTφ(x) = aTΦφ(x) = k(x)T (K + λIN)−1 t\\n(6.9)\\nwhere we have deﬁned the vector k(x) with elements kn(x) = k(xn, x). Thus we\\nsee that the dual formulation allows the solution to the least-squares problem to be\\nexpressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x′). This is known as a dual\\nformulation because, by noting that the solution for a can be expressed as a linear\\ncombination of the elements of φ(x), we recover the original formulation in terms of\\nthe parameter vector w. Note that the prediction at x is given by a linear combination\\nExercise 6.1\\nof the target values from the training set. In fact, we have already obtained this result,\\nusing a slightly different notation, in Section 3.3.3.\\nIn the dual formulation, we determine the parameter vector a by inverting an\\nN × N matrix, whereas in the original parameter space formulation we had to invert\\nan M × M matrix in order to determine w. Because N is typically much larger\\nthan M, the dual formulation does not seem to be particularly useful. However, the\\nadvantage of the dual formulation, as we shall see, is that it is expressed entirely in\\nterms of the kernel function k(x, x′). We can therefore work directly in terms of\\nkernels and avoid the explicit introduction of the feature vector φ(x), which allows\\nus implicitly to use feature spaces of high, even inﬁnite, dimensionality.\\nThe existence of a dual representation based on the Gram matrix is a property of\\nmany linear models, including the perceptron. In Section 6.4, we will develop a dual-\\nExercise 6.2\\nity between probabilistic linear models for regression and the technique of Gaussian\\nprocesses. Duality will also play an important role when we discuss support vector\\nmachines in Chapter 7.\\n6.2. Constructing Kernels\\nIn order to exploit kernel substitution, we need to be able to construct valid kernel\\nfunctions. One approach is to choose a feature space mapping φ(x) and then use\\nthis to ﬁnd the corresponding kernel, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Here the kernel\\nfunction is deﬁned for a one-dimensional input space by\\nk(x, x′) = φ(x)Tφ(x′) =\\nM\\n\\x02\\ni=1\\nφi(x)φi(x′)\\n(6.10)\\nwhere φi(x) are the basis functions.\\nAn alternative approach is to construct kernel functions directly. In this case,\\nwe must ensure that the function we choose is a valid kernel, in other words that it\\ncorresponds to a scalar product in some (perhaps inﬁnite dimensional) feature space.\\nAs a simple example, consider a kernel function given by\\nk(x, z) =\\n\\nxTz\\n\\x0b2 .\\n(6.11)'),\n",

We require that the kernel\\nk(x, x′) be symmetric and positive semideﬁnite and that it expresses the appropriate\\nform of similarity between x and x′ according to the intended application. Here we\\nconsider a few common examples of kernel functions. For a more extensive discus-\\nsion of ‘kernel engineering’, see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004).\\nWe saw that the simple polynomial kernel k(x, x′) = \\nxTx′\\x0b2 contains only\\nterms of degree two.\\nIf we consider the slightly generalized kernel k(x, x′) =\\n\\nxTx′ + c\\x0b2 with c > 0, then the corresponding feature mapping φ(x) contains con-\\nstant and linear terms as well as terms of order two. Similarly, k(x, x′) =\\n\\nxTx′\\x0bM\\ncontains all monomials of order M. For instance, if x and x′ are two images, then\\nthe kernel represents a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M pixels\\nin the ﬁrst image with M pixels in the second image. This can similarly be gener-\\nalized to include all terms up to degree M by considering k(x, x′) =\\n\\nxTx′ + c\\n\\x0bM\\nwith c > 0. Using the results (6.17) and (6.18) for combining kernels we see that\\nthese will all be valid kernel functions.\\nAnother commonly used kernel takes the form\\nk(x, x′) = exp\\n\\n−∥x −x′∥2/2σ2\\x0b\\n(6.23)\\nand is often called a ‘Gaussian’ kernel.

Kernel\\nfunctions can be deﬁned over objects as diverse as graphs, sets, strings, and text doc-\\numents. Consider, for instance, a ﬁxed set and deﬁne a nonvectorial space consisting\\nof all possible subsets of this set. If A1 and A2 are two such subsets then one simple\\nchoice of kernel would be\\nk(A1, A2) = 2|A1∩A2|\\n(6.27)\\nwhere A1 ∩A2 denotes the intersection of sets A1 and A2, and |A| denotes the\\nnumber of subsets in A. This is a valid kernel function because it can be shown to\\ncorrespond to an inner product in a feature space.\\nExercise 6.12\\nOne powerful approach to the construction of kernels starts from a probabilistic\\ngenerative model (Haussler, 1999), which allows us to apply generative models in a\\ndiscriminative setting. Generative models can deal naturally with missing data and\\nin the case of hidden Markov models can handle sequences of varying length. By\\ncontrast, discriminative models generally give better performance on discriminative\\ntasks than generative models. It is therefore of some interest to combine these two\\napproaches (Lasserre et al., 2006). One way to combine them is to use a generative\\nmodel to deﬁne a kernel, and then use this kernel in a discriminative approach.\\nGiven a generative model p(x) we can deﬁne a kernel by\\nk(x, x′) = p(x)p(x′).\\n(6.28)\\nThis is clearly a valid kernel function because we can interpret it as an inner product\\nin the one-dimensional feature space deﬁned by the mapping p(x). It says that two\\ninputs x and x′ are similar if they both have high probabilities. We can use (6.13) and\\n(6.17) to extend this class of kernels by considering sums over products of different\\nprobability distributions, with positive weighting coefﬁcients p(i), of the form\\nk(x, x′) =\\n\\x02\\ni\\np(x|i)p(x′|i)p(i).\\n(6.29)'),\n",

KERNEL METHODS\\nThis is equivalent, up to an overall multiplicative constant, to a mixture distribution\\nin which the components factorize, with the index i playing the role of a ‘latent’\\nvariable. Two inputs x and x′ will give a large value for the kernel function, and\\nSection 9.2\\nhence appear similar, if they have signiﬁcant probability under a range of different\\ncomponents. Taking the limit of an inﬁnite sum, we can also consider kernels of the\\nform\\nk(x, x′) =\\n\\x06\\np(x|z)p(x′|z)p(z) dz\\n(6.30)\\nwhere z is a continuous latent variable.\\nNow suppose that our data consists of ordered sequences of length L so that\\nan observation is given by X = {x1, . . . , xL}. A popular generative model for\\nsequences is the hidden Markov model, which expresses the distribution p(X) as a\\nSection 13.2\\nmarginalization over a corresponding sequence of hidden states Z = {z1, . . . , zL}.\\nWe can use this approach to deﬁne a kernel function measuring the similarity of two\\nsequences X and X′ by extending the mixture representation (6.29) to give\\nk(X, X′) =\\n\\x02\\nZ\\np(X|Z)p(X′|Z)p(Z)\\n(6.31)\\nso that both observed sequences are generated by the same hidden sequence Z. This\\nmodel can easily be extended to allow sequences of differing length to be compared.\\nAn alternative technique for using generative models to deﬁne kernel functions\\nis known as the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999). Consider a parametric\\ngenerative model p(x|θ) where θ denotes the vector of parameters. The goal is to\\nﬁnd a kernel that measures the similarity of two input vectors x and x′ induced by the\\ngenerative model. Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) consider the gradient with respect\\nto θ, which deﬁnes a vector in a ‘feature’ space having the same dimensionality as\\nθ. In particular, they consider the Fisher score\\ng(θ, x) = ∇θ ln p(x|θ)\\n(6.32)\\nfrom which the Fisher kernel is deﬁned by\\nk(x, x′) = g(θ, x)TF−1g(θ, x′).\\n(6.33)\\nHere F is the Fisher information matrix, given by\\nF = Ex\\n\\x08\\ng(θ, x)g(θ, x)T\\t\\n(6.34)\\nwhere the expectation is with respect to x under the distribution p(x|θ). This can\\nbe motivated from the perspective of information geometry (Amari, 1998), which\\nconsiders the differential geometry of the space of model parameters. Here we sim-\\nply note that the presence of the Fisher information matrix causes this kernel to be\\ninvariant under a nonlinear re-parameterization of the density model θ →ψ(θ).\\nExercise 6.13\\nIn practice, it is often infeasible to evaluate the Fisher information matrix. One\\napproach is simply to replace the expectation in the deﬁnition of the Fisher informa-\\ntion with the sample average, giving\\nF ≃1\\nN\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\ng(θ, xn)g(θ, xn)T.\\n(6.35)'),\n",

As we shall see, in the limit of an inﬁnite number of basis functions,\\na Bayesian neural network with an appropriate prior reduces to a Gaussian process,\\nthereby providing a deeper link between neural networks and kernel methods.\\nSection 6.4.7\\n6.3. Radial Basis Function Networks\\nIn Chapter 3, we discussed regression models based on linear combinations of ﬁxed\\nbasis functions, although we did not discuss in detail what form those basis functions\\nmight take. One choice that has been widely used is that of radial basis functions,\\nwhich have the property that each basis function depends only on the radial distance\\n(typically Euclidean) from a centre µj, so that φj(x) = h(∥x −µj∥).\\nHistorically, radial basis functions were introduced for the purpose of exact func-\\ntion interpolation (Powell, 1987). Given a set of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along\\nwith corresponding target values {t1, . . . , tN}, the goal is to ﬁnd a smooth function\\nf(x) that ﬁts every target value exactly, so that f(xn) = tn for n = 1, . . . , N. This\\nis achieved by expressing f(x) as a linear combination of radial basis functions, one\\ncentred on every data point\\nf(x) =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nwnh(∥x −xn∥).\\n(6.38)\\nThe values of the coefﬁcients {wn} are found by least squares, and because there\\nare the same number of coefﬁcients as there are constraints, the result is a function\\nthat ﬁts every target value exactly. In pattern recognition applications, however, the\\ntarget values are generally noisy, and exact interpolation is undesirable because this\\ncorresponds to an over-ﬁtted solution.\\nExpansions in radial basis functions also arise from regularization theory (Pog-\\ngio and Girosi, 1990; Bishop, 1995a). For a sum-of-squares error function with a\\nregularizer deﬁned in terms of a differential operator, the optimal solution is given\\nby an expansion in the Green’s functions of the operator (which are analogous to the\\neigenvectors of a discrete matrix), again with one basis function centred on each data'),\n",

KERNEL METHODS\\npoint. If the differential operator is isotropic then the Green’s functions depend only\\non the radial distance from the corresponding data point. Due to the presence of the\\nregularizer, the solution no longer interpolates the training data exactly.\\nAnother motivation for radial basis functions comes from a consideration of\\nthe interpolation problem when the input (rather than the target) variables are noisy\\n(Webb, 1994; Bishop, 1995a). If the noise on the input variable x is described\\nby a variable ξ having a distribution ν(ξ), then the sum-of-squares error function\\nbecomes\\nE = 1\\n2\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\n\\x06\\n{y(xn + ξ) −tn}2 ν(ξ) dξ.\\n(6.39)\\nUsing the calculus of variations, we can optimize with respect to the function f(x)\\nAppendix D\\nto give\\nExercise 6.17\\ny(xn) =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\ntnh(x −xn)\\n(6.40)\\nwhere the basis functions are given by\\nh(x −xn) =\\nν(x −xn)\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nν(x −xn)\\n.\\n(6.41)\\nWe see that there is one basis function centred on every data point. This is known as\\nthe Nadaraya-Watson model and will be derived again from a different perspective\\nin Section 6.3.1. If the noise distribution ν(ξ) is isotropic, so that it is a function\\nonly of ∥ξ∥, then the basis functions will be radial.\\nNote that the basis functions (6.41) are normalized, so that \\x05\\nn h(x −xn) = 1\\nfor any value of x. The effect of such normalization is shown in Figure 6.2. Normal-\\nization is sometimes used in practice as it avoids having regions of input space where\\nall of the basis functions take small values, which would necessarily lead to predic-\\ntions in such regions that are either small or controlled purely by the bias parameter.\\nAnother situation in which expansions in normalized radial basis functions arise\\nis in the application of kernel density estimation to the problem of regression, as we\\nshall discuss in Section 6.3.1.\\nBecause there is one basis function associated with every data point, the corre-\\nsponding model can be computationally costly to evaluate when making predictions\\nfor new data points. Models have therefore been proposed (Broomhead and Lowe,\\n1988; Moody and Darken, 1989; Poggio and Girosi, 1990), which retain the expan-\\nsion in radial basis functions but where the number M of basis functions is smaller\\nthan the number N of data points.

KERNEL METHODS\\ntic discriminative models, leading to the framework of Gaussian processes. We shall\\nthereby see how kernels arise naturally in a Bayesian setting.\\nIn Chapter 3, we considered linear regression models of the form y(x, w) =\\nwTφ(x) in which w is a vector of parameters and φ(x) is a vector of ﬁxed nonlinear\\nbasis functions that depend on the input vector x. We showed that a prior distribution\\nover w induced a corresponding prior distribution over functions y(x, w). Given a\\ntraining data set, we then evaluated the posterior distribution over w and thereby\\nobtained the corresponding posterior distribution over regression functions, which\\nin turn (with the addition of noise) implies a predictive distribution p(t|x) for new\\ninput vectors x.\\nIn the Gaussian process viewpoint, we dispense with the parametric model and\\ninstead deﬁne a prior probability distribution over functions directly. At ﬁrst sight, it\\nmight seem difﬁcult to work with a distribution over the uncountably inﬁnite space of\\nfunctions. However, as we shall see, for a ﬁnite training set we only need to consider\\nthe values of the function at the discrete set of input values xn corresponding to the\\ntraining set and test set data points, and so in practice we can work in a ﬁnite space.\\nModels equivalent to Gaussian processes have been widely studied in many dif-\\nferent ﬁelds. For instance, in the geostatistics literature Gaussian process regression\\nis known as kriging (Cressie, 1993). Similarly, ARMA (autoregressive moving aver-\\nage) models, Kalman ﬁlters, and radial basis function networks can all be viewed as\\nforms of Gaussian process models. Reviews of Gaussian processes from a machine\\nlearning perspective can be found in MacKay (1998), Williams (1999), and MacKay\\n(2003), and a comparison of Gaussian process models with alternative approaches is\\ngiven in Rasmussen (1996). See also Rasmussen and Williams (2006) for a recent\\ntextbook on Gaussian processes.\\n6.4.1\\nLinear regression revisited\\nIn order to motivate the Gaussian process viewpoint, let us return to the linear\\nregression example and re-derive the predictive distribution by working in terms\\nof distributions over functions y(x, w). This will provide a speciﬁc example of a\\nGaussian process.\\nConsider a model deﬁned in terms of a linear combination of M ﬁxed basis\\nfunctions given by the elements of the vector φ(x) so that\\ny(x) = wTφ(x)\\n(6.49)\\nwhere x is the input vector and w is the M-dimensional weight vector. Now consider\\na prior distribution over w given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form\\np(w) = N(w|0, α−1I)\\n(6.50)\\ngoverned by the hyperparameter α, which represents the precision (inverse variance)\\nof the distribution. For any given value of w, the deﬁnition (6.49) deﬁnes a partic-\\nular function of x. The probability distribution over w deﬁned by (6.50) therefore\\ninduces a probability distribution over functions y(x). In practice, we wish to eval-\\nuate this function at speciﬁc values of x, for example at the training data points'),\n",

More generally, a\\nstochastic process y(x) is speciﬁed by giving the joint probability distribution for\\nany ﬁnite set of values y(x1), . . . , y(xN) in a consistent manner.\\nA key point about Gaussian stochastic processes is that the joint distribution\\nover N variables y1, . . . , yN is speciﬁed completely by the second-order statistics,\\nnamely the mean and the covariance. In most applications, we will not have any\\nprior knowledge about the mean of y(x) and so by symmetry we take it to be zero.\\nThis is equivalent to choosing the mean of the prior over weight values p(w|α) to\\nbe zero in the basis function viewpoint. The speciﬁcation of the Gaussian process is\\nthen completed by giving the covariance of y(x) evaluated at any two values of x,\\nwhich is given by the kernel function\\nE [y(xn)y(xm)] = k(xn, xm).\\n(6.55)\\nFor the speciﬁc case of a Gaussian process deﬁned by the linear regression model\\n(6.49) with a weight prior (6.50), the kernel function is given by (6.54).\\nWe can also deﬁne the kernel function directly, rather than indirectly through a\\nchoice of basis function. Figure 6.4 shows samples of functions drawn from Gaus-\\nsian processes for two different choices of kernel function.

Gaussian Processes\\n311\\nsian process regression have also been considered, for purposes such as modelling\\nthe distribution over low-dimensional manifolds for unsupervised learning (Bishop\\net al., 1998a) and the solution of stochastic differential equations (Graepel, 2003).\\n6.4.3\\nLearning the hyperparameters\\nThe predictions of a Gaussian process model will depend, in part, on the choice\\nof covariance function. In practice, rather than ﬁxing the covariance function, we\\nmay prefer to use a parametric family of functions and then infer the parameter\\nvalues from the data. These parameters govern such things as the length scale of the\\ncorrelations and the precision of the noise and correspond to the hyperparameters in\\na standard parametric model.\\nTechniques for learning the hyperparameters are based on the evaluation of the\\nlikelihood function p(t|θ) where θ denotes the hyperparameters of the Gaussian pro-\\ncess model. The simplest approach is to make a point estimate of θ by maximizing\\nthe log likelihood function. Because θ represents a set of hyperparameters for the\\nregression problem, this can be viewed as analogous to the type 2 maximum like-\\nlihood procedure for linear regression models. Maximization of the log likelihood\\nSection 3.5\\ncan be done using efﬁcient gradient-based optimization algorithms such as conjugate\\ngradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008).\\nThe log likelihood function for a Gaussian process regression model is easily\\nevaluated using the standard form for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, giving\\nln p(t|θ) = −1\\n2 ln |CN| −1\\n2tTC−1\\nN t −N\\n2 ln(2π).\\n(6.69)\\nFor nonlinear optimization, we also need the gradient of the log likelihood func-\\ntion with respect to the parameter vector θ. We shall assume that evaluation of the\\nderivatives of CN is straightforward, as would be the case for the covariance func-\\ntions considered in this chapter. Making use of the result (C.21) for the derivative of\\nC−1\\nN , together with the result (C.22) for the derivative of ln |CN|, we obtain\\n∂\\n∂θi\\nln p(t|θ) = −1\\n2Tr\\n\\x0f\\nC−1\\nN\\n∂CN\\n∂θi\\n\\x10\\n+ 1\\n2tTC−1\\nN\\n∂CN\\n∂θi\\nC−1\\nN t.\\n(6.70)\\nBecause ln p(t|θ) will in general be a nonconvex function, it can have multiple max-\\nima.\\nIt is straightforward to introduce a prior over θ and to maximize the log poste-\\nrior using gradient-based methods. In a fully Bayesian treatment, we need to evaluate\\nmarginals over θ weighted by the product of the prior p(θ) and the likelihood func-\\ntion p(t|θ). In general, however, exact marginalization will be intractable, and we\\nmust resort to approximations.\\nThe Gaussian process regression model gives a predictive distribution whose\\nmean and variance are functions of the input vector x. However, we have assumed\\nthat the contribution to the predictive variance arising from the additive noise, gov-\\nerned by the parameter β, is a constant. For some problems, known as heteroscedas-\\ntic, the noise variance itself will also depend on x. To model this, we can extend the'),\n",

The result, as we shall see, is\\nthat the optimization of these parameters by maximum likelihood allows the relative\\nimportance of different inputs to be inferred from the data. This represents an exam-\\nple in the Gaussian process context of automatic relevance determination, or ARD,\\nwhich was originally formulated in the framework of neural networks (MacKay,\\n1994; Neal, 1996). The mechanism by which appropriate inputs are preferred is\\ndiscussed in Section 7.2.2.\\nConsider a Gaussian process with a two-dimensional input space x = (x1, x2),\\nhaving a kernel function of the form\\nk(x, x′) = θ0 exp\\n\\x18\\n−1\\n2\\n2\\n\\x02\\ni=1\\nηi(xi −x′\\ni)2\\n\\x19\\n.\\n(6.71)\\nSamples from the resulting prior over functions y(x) are shown for two different\\nsettings of the precision parameters ηi in Figure 6.9.

By adapting these parameters to a data set using\\nmaximum likelihood, it becomes possible to detect input variables that have little\\neffect on the predictive distribution, because the corresponding values of ηi will be\\nsmall. This can be useful in practice because it allows such inputs to be discarded.\\nARD is illustrated using a simple synthetic data set having three inputs x1, x2 and x3\\n(Nabney, 2002) in Figure 6.10.

Alternatively, we can consider techniques based on\\nan analytical approximation. In Section 4.5.2, we derived the approximate formula\\n(4.153) for the convolution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian distribution. We\\ncan use this result to evaluate the integral in (6.76) provided we have a Gaussian\\napproximation to the posterior distribution p(aN+1|tN). The usual justiﬁcation for a\\nGaussian approximation to a posterior distribution is that the true posterior will tend\\nto a Gaussian as the number of data points increases as a consequence of the central\\nlimit theorem. In the case of Gaussian processes, the number of variables grows with\\nSection 2.3\\nthe number of data points, and so this argument does not apply directly. However, if\\nwe consider increasing the number of data points falling in a ﬁxed region of x space,\\nthen the corresponding uncertainty in the function a(x) will decrease, again leading\\nasymptotically to a Gaussian (Williams and Barber, 1998).\\nThree different approaches to obtaining a Gaussian approximation have been\\nconsidered. One technique is based on variational inference (Gibbs and MacKay,\\nSection 10.1\\n2000) and makes use of the local variational bound (10.144) on the logistic sigmoid.\\nThis allows the product of sigmoid functions to be approximated by a product of\\nGaussians thereby allowing the marginalization over aN to be performed analyti-\\ncally. The approach also yields a lower bound on the likelihood function p(tN|θ).\\nThe variational framework for Gaussian process classiﬁcation can also be extended\\nto multiclass (K > 2) problems by using a Gaussian approximation to the softmax\\nfunction (Gibbs, 1997).\\nA second approach uses expectation propagation (Opper and Winther, 2000b;\\nSection 10.7\\nMinka, 2001b; Seeger, 2003). Because the true posterior distribution is unimodal, as\\nwe shall see shortly, the expectation propagation approach can give good results.\\n6.4.6\\nLaplace approximation\\nThe third approach to Gaussian process classiﬁcation is based on the Laplace\\napproximation, which we now consider in detail.

In the framework of maximum likelihood, the number of hidden units\\nneeds to be limited (to a level dependent on the size of the training set) in order\\nto avoid over-ﬁtting. However, from a Bayesian perspective it makes little sense to\\nlimit the number of parameters in the network according to the size of the training\\nset.\\nIn a Bayesian neural network, the prior distribution over the parameter vector\\nw, in conjunction with the network function f(x, w), produces a prior distribution\\nover functions from y(x) where y is the vector of network outputs. Neal (1996)\\nhas shown that, for a broad class of prior distributions over w, the distribution of\\nfunctions generated by a neural network will tend to a Gaussian process in the limit\\nM →∞. It should be noted, however, that in this limit the output variables of the\\nneural network become independent. One of the great merits of neural networks is\\nthat the outputs share the hidden units and so they can ‘borrow statistical strength’\\nfrom each other, that is, the weights associated with each hidden unit are inﬂuenced\\nby all of the output variables not just by one of them. This property is therefore lost\\nin the Gaussian process limit.\\nWe have seen that a Gaussian process is determined by its covariance (kernel)\\nfunction. Williams (1998) has given explicit forms for the covariance in the case of\\ntwo speciﬁc choices for the hidden unit activation function (probit and Gaussian).\\nThese kernel functions k(x, x′) are nonstationary, i.e. they cannot be expressed as\\na function of the difference x −x′, as a consequence of the Gaussian weight prior\\nbeing centred on zero which breaks translation invariance in weight space.'),\n",

The training data set comprises N input vectors x1, . . . , xN, with\\ncorresponding target values t1, . . . , tN where tn ∈{−1, 1}, and new data points x\\nare classiﬁed according to the sign of y(x).\\nWe shall assume for the moment that the training data set is linearly separable in\\nfeature space, so that by deﬁnition there exists at least one choice of the parameters\\nw and b such that a function of the form (7.1) satisﬁes y(xn) > 0 for points having\\ntn = +1 and y(xn) < 0 for points having tn = −1, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all\\ntraining data points.\\nThere may of course exist many such solutions that separate the classes exactly.\\nIn Section 4.1.7, we described the perceptron algorithm that is guaranteed to ﬁnd\\na solution in a ﬁnite number of steps. The solution that it ﬁnds, however, will be\\ndependent on the (arbitrary) initial values chosen for w and b as well as on the\\norder in which the data points are presented. If there are multiple solutions all of\\nwhich classify the training data set exactly, then we should try to ﬁnd the one that\\nwill give the smallest generalization error. The support vector machine approaches\\nthis problem through the concept of the margin, which is deﬁned to be the smallest\\ndistance between the decision boundary and any of the samples, as illustrated in\\nFigure 7.1.\\nIn support vector machines the decision boundary is chosen to be the one for\\nwhich the margin is maximized. The maximum margin solution can be motivated us-\\ning computational learning theory, also known as statistical learning theory. How-\\nSection 7.1.5\\never, a simple insight into the origins of maximum margin has been given by Tong\\nand Koller (2000) who consider a framework for classiﬁcation based on a hybrid of\\ngenerative and discriminative approaches. They ﬁrst model the distribution over in-\\nput vectors x for each class using a Parzen density estimator with Gaussian kernels'),\n",

In the limit σ2 →0, the optimal hyperplane\\nis shown to be the one having maximum margin. The intuition behind this result is\\nthat as σ2 is reduced, the hyperplane is increasingly dominated by nearby data points\\nrelative to more distant ones. In the limit, the hyperplane becomes independent of\\ndata points that are not support vectors.\\nWe shall see in Figure 10.13 that marginalization with respect to the prior distri-\\nbution of the parameters in a Bayesian approach for a simple linearly separable data\\nset leads to a decision boundary that lies in the middle of the region separating the\\ndata points. The large margin solution has similar behaviour.\\nRecall from Figure 4.1 that the perpendicular distance of a point x from a hyper-\\nplane deﬁned by y(x) = 0 where y(x) takes the form (7.1) is given by |y(x)|/∥w∥.\\nFurthermore, we are only interested in solutions for which all data points are cor-\\nrectly classiﬁed, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all n.

The maximum margin hyperplane is deﬁned by the location of the support\\nvectors. Other data points can be moved around freely (so long as they remain out-\\nside the margin region) without changing the decision boundary, and so the solution\\nwill be independent of such data points.\\n7.1.1\\nOverlapping class distributions\\nSo far, we have assumed that the training data points are linearly separable in the\\nfeature space φ(x). The resulting support vector machine will give exact separation\\nof the training data in the original input space x, although the corresponding decision\\nboundary will be nonlinear. In practice, however, the class-conditional distributions\\nmay overlap, in which case exact separation of the training data can lead to poor\\ngeneralization.\\nWe therefore need a way to modify the support vector machine so as to allow\\nsome of the training points to be misclassiﬁed. From (7.19) we see that in the case\\nof separable classes, we implicitly used an error function that gave inﬁnite error\\nif a data point was misclassiﬁed and zero error if it was classiﬁed correctly, and\\nthen optimized the model parameters to maximize the margin. We now modify this\\napproach so that data points are allowed to be on the ‘wrong side’ of the margin\\nboundary, but with a penalty that increases with the distance from that boundary. For\\nthe subsequent optimization problem, it is convenient to make this penalty a linear\\nfunction of this distance. To do this, we introduce slack variables, ξn ⩾0 where\\nn = 1, . . . , N, with one slack variable for each training data point (Bennett, 1992;\\nCortes and Vapnik, 1995). These are deﬁned by ξn = 0 for data points that are on or\\ninside the correct margin boundary and ξn = |tn −y(xn)| for other points. Thus a\\ndata point that is on the decision boundary y(xn) = 0 will have ξn = 1, and points'),\n",

We ﬁrst note that the objective function \\x04L(a)\\ngiven by (7.10) or (7.32) is quadratic and so any local optimum will also be a global\\noptimum provided the constraints deﬁne a convex region (which they do as a conse-\\nquence of being linear). Direct solution of the quadratic programming problem us-\\ning traditional techniques is often infeasible due to the demanding computation and\\nmemory requirements, and so more practical approaches need to be found. The tech-\\nnique of chunking (Vapnik, 1982) exploits the fact that the value of the Lagrangian\\nis unchanged if we remove the rows and columns of the kernel matrix corresponding\\nto Lagrange multipliers that have value zero. This allows the full quadratic pro-\\ngramming problem to be broken down into a series of smaller ones, whose goal is\\neventually to identify all of the nonzero Lagrange multipliers and discard the others.\\nChunking can be implemented using protected conjugate gradients (Burges, 1998).\\nAlthough chunking reduces the size of the matrix in the quadratic function from the\\nnumber of data points squared to approximately the number of nonzero Lagrange\\nmultipliers squared, even this may be too big to ﬁt in memory for large-scale appli-\\ncations. Decomposition methods (Osuna et al., 1996) also solve a series of smaller\\nquadratic programming problems but are designed so that each of these is of a ﬁxed\\nsize, and so the technique can be applied to arbitrarily large data sets. However, it\\nstill involves numerical solution of quadratic programming subproblems and these\\ncan be problematic and expensive. One of the most popular approaches to training\\nsupport vector machines is called sequential minimal optimization, or SMO (Platt,\\n1999). It takes the concept of chunking to the extreme limit and considers just two\\nLagrange multipliers at a time. In this case, the subproblem can be solved analyti-\\ncally, thereby avoiding numerical quadratic programming altogether. Heuristics are\\ngiven for choosing the pair of Lagrange multipliers to be considered at each step.\\nIn practice, SMO is found to have a scaling with the number of data points that is\\nsomewhere between linear and quadratic depending on the particular application.\\nWe have seen that kernel functions correspond to inner products in feature spaces\\nthat can have high, or even inﬁnite, dimensionality. By working directly in terms of\\nthe kernel function, without introducing the feature space explicitly, it might there-\\nfore seem that support vector machines somehow manage to avoid the curse of di-'),\n",

However, the coefﬁcients weighting these different\\nfeatures are constrained to have speciﬁc forms. Thus any set of points in the original\\ntwo-dimensional space x would be constrained to lie exactly on a two-dimensional\\nnonlinear manifold embedded in the six-dimensional feature space.\\nWe have already highlighted the fact that the support vector machine does not\\nprovide probabilistic outputs but instead makes classiﬁcation decisions for new in-\\nput vectors. Veropoulos et al. (1999) discuss modiﬁcations to the SVM to allow\\nthe trade-off between false positive and false negative errors to be controlled. How-\\never, if we wish to use the SVM as a module in a larger probabilistic system, then\\nprobabilistic predictions of the class label t for new inputs x are required.\\nTo address this issue, Platt (2000) has proposed ﬁtting a logistic sigmoid to the\\noutputs of a previously trained support vector machine. Speciﬁcally, the required\\nconditional probability is assumed to be of the form\\np(t = 1|x) = σ (Ay(x) + B)\\n(7.43)\\nwhere y(x) is deﬁned by (7.1). Values for the parameters A and B are found by\\nminimizing the cross-entropy error function deﬁned by a training set consisting of\\npairs of values y(xn) and tn. The data used to ﬁt the sigmoid needs to be independent\\nof that used to train the original SVM in order to avoid severe over-ﬁtting. This two-\\nstage approach is equivalent to assuming that the output y(x) of the support vector\\nmachine represents the log-odds of x belonging to class t = 1.

This rescaled error function is also plotted\\nin Figure 7.5 and we see that it has a similar form to the support vector error function.\\nThe key difference is that the ﬂat region in ESV(yt) leads to sparse solutions.\\nBoth the logistic error and the hinge loss can be viewed as continuous approx-\\nimations to the misclassiﬁcation error. Another continuous error function that has\\nsometimes been used to solve classiﬁcation problems is the squared error, which\\nis again plotted in Figure 7.5. It has the property, however, of placing increasing\\nemphasis on data points that are correctly classiﬁed but that are a long way from\\nthe decision boundary on the correct side. Such points will be strongly weighted at\\nthe expense of misclassiﬁed points, and so if the objective is to minimize the mis-\\nclassiﬁcation rate, then a monotonically decreasing error function would be a better\\nchoice.\\n7.1.3\\nMulticlass SVMs\\nThe support vector machine is fundamentally a two-class classiﬁer. In practice,\\nhowever, we often have to tackle problems involving K > 2 classes. Various meth-\\nods have therefore been proposed for combining multiple two-class SVMs in order\\nto build a multiclass classiﬁer.\\nOne commonly used approach (Vapnik, 1998) is to construct K separate SVMs,\\nin which the kth model yk(x) is trained using the data from class Ck as the positive\\nexamples and the data from the remaining K −1 classes as the negative examples.\\nThis is known as the one-versus-the-rest approach. However, in Figure 4.2 we saw\\nthat using the decisions of the individual classiﬁers can lead to inconsistent results\\nin which an input is assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. This problem is\\nsometimes addressed by making predictions for new inputs x using\\ny(x) = max\\nk\\nyk(x).\\n(7.49)\\nUnfortunately, this heuristic approach suffers from the problem that the different\\nclassiﬁers were trained on different tasks, and there is no guarantee that the real-\\nvalued quantities yk(x) for different classiﬁers will have appropriate scales.\\nAnother problem with the one-versus-the-rest approach is that the training sets\\nare imbalanced. For instance, if we have ten classes each with equal numbers of\\ntraining data points, then the individual classiﬁers are trained on data sets comprising\\n90% negative examples and only 10% positive examples, and the symmetry of the\\noriginal problem is lost. A variant of the one-versus-the-rest scheme was proposed\\nby Lee et al. (2001) who modify the target values so that the positive class has target\\n+1 and the negative class has target −1/(K −1).\\nWeston and Watkins (1999) deﬁne a single objective function for training all\\nK SVMs simultaneously, based on maximizing the margin from each to remaining\\nclasses. However, this can result in much slower training because, instead of solving\\nK separate optimization problems each over N data points with an overall cost of\\nO(KN 2), a single optimization problem of size (K −1)N must be solved giving an\\noverall cost of O(K2N 2).'),\n",

Maximum Margin Classiﬁers\\n339\\nAnother approach is to train K(K −1)/2 different 2-class SVMs on all possible\\npairs of classes, and then to classify test points according to which class has the high-\\nest number of ‘votes’, an approach that is sometimes called one-versus-one. Again,\\nwe saw in Figure 4.2 that this can lead to ambiguities in the resulting classiﬁcation.\\nAlso, for large K this approach requires signiﬁcantly more training time than the\\none-versus-the-rest approach. Similarly, to evaluate test points, signiﬁcantly more\\ncomputation is required.\\nThe latter problem can be alleviated by organizing the pairwise classiﬁers into\\na directed acyclic graph (not to be confused with a probabilistic graphical model)\\nleading to the DAGSVM (Platt et al., 2000). For K classes, the DAGSVM has a total\\nof K(K −1)/2 classiﬁers, and to classify a new test point only K −1 pairwise\\nclassiﬁers need to be evaluated, with the particular classiﬁers used depending on\\nwhich path through the graph is traversed.\\nA different approach to multiclass classiﬁcation, based on error-correcting out-\\nput codes, was developed by Dietterich and Bakiri (1995) and applied to support\\nvector machines by Allwein et al. (2000). This can be viewed as a generalization of\\nthe voting scheme of the one-versus-one approach in which more general partitions\\nof the classes are used to train the individual classiﬁers. The K classes themselves\\nare represented as particular sets of responses from the two-class classiﬁers chosen,\\nand together with a suitable decoding scheme, this gives robustness to errors and to\\nambiguity in the outputs of the individual classiﬁers. Although the application of\\nSVMs to multiclass classiﬁcation problems remains an open issue, in practice the\\none-versus-the-rest approach is the most widely used in spite of its ad-hoc formula-\\ntion and its practical limitations.\\nThere are also single-class support vector machines, which solve an unsuper-\\nvised learning problem related to probability density estimation. Instead of mod-\\nelling the density of data, however, these methods aim to ﬁnd a smooth boundary\\nenclosing a region of high density. The boundary is chosen to represent a quantile of\\nthe density, that is, the probability that a data point drawn from the distribution will\\nland inside that region is given by a ﬁxed number between 0 and 1 that is speciﬁed in\\nadvance. This is a more restricted problem than estimating the full density but may\\nbe sufﬁcient in speciﬁc applications. Two approaches to this problem using support\\nvector machines have been proposed. The algorithm of Sch¨olkopf et al. (2001) tries\\nto ﬁnd a hyperplane that separates all but a ﬁxed fraction ν of the training data from\\nthe origin while at the same time maximizing the distance (margin) of the hyperplane\\nfrom the origin, while Tax and Duin (1999) look for the smallest sphere in feature\\nspace that contains all but a fraction ν of the data points.

This has its origins with Valiant (1984)\\nwho formulated the probably approximately correct, or PAC, learning framework.\\nThe goal of the PAC framework is to understand how large a data set needs to be in\\norder to give good generalization. It also gives bounds for the computational cost of\\nlearning, although we do not consider these here.\\nSuppose that a data set D of size N is drawn from some joint distribution p(x, t)\\nwhere x is the input variable and t represents the class label, and that we restrict\\nattention to ‘noise free’ situations in which the class labels are determined by some\\n(unknown) deterministic function t = g(x). In PAC learning we say that a function\\nf(x; D), drawn from a space F of such functions on the basis of the training set\\nD, has good generalization if its expected error rate is below some pre-speciﬁed\\nthreshold ϵ, so that\\nEx,t [I (f(x; D) ̸= t)] < ϵ\\n(7.75)\\nwhere I(·) is the indicator function, and the expectation is with respect to the dis-\\ntribution p(x, t). The quantity on the left-hand side is a random variable, because\\nit depends on the training set D, and the PAC framework requires that (7.75) holds,\\nwith probability greater than 1 −δ, for a data set D drawn randomly from p(x, t).\\nHere δ is another pre-speciﬁed parameter, and the terminology ‘probably approxi-\\nmately correct’ comes from the requirement that with high probability (greater than\\n1−δ), the error rate be small (less than ϵ). For a given choice of model space F, and\\nfor given parameters ϵ and δ, PAC learning aims to provide bounds on the minimum\\nsize N of data set needed to meet this criterion. A key quantity in PAC learning is\\nthe Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension, which provides a measure of\\nthe complexity of a space of functions, and which allows the PAC framework to be\\nextended to spaces containing an inﬁnite number of functions.\\nThe bounds derived within the PAC framework are often described as worst-'),\n",

For this\\nreason, PAC bounds have found few, if any, practical applications.\\nOne attempt to improve the tightness of the PAC bounds is the PAC-Bayesian\\nframework (McAllester, 2003), which considers a distribution over the space F of\\nfunctions, somewhat analogous to the prior in a Bayesian treatment.

Relevance Vector Machines\\nSupport vector machines have been used in a variety of classiﬁcation and regres-\\nsion applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations, several\\nof which have been highlighted already in this chapter. In particular, the outputs of\\nan SVM represent decisions rather than posterior probabilities. Also, the SVM was\\noriginally formulated for two classes, and the extension to K > 2 classes is prob-\\nlematic. There is a complexity parameter C, or ν (as well as a parameter ϵ in the case\\nof regression), that must be found using a hold-out method such as cross-validation.\\nFinally, predictions are expressed as linear combinations of kernel functions that are\\ncentred on training data points and that are required to be positive deﬁnite.\\nThe relevance vector machine or RVM (Tipping, 2001) is a Bayesian sparse ker-\\nnel technique for regression and classiﬁcation that shares many of the characteristics\\nof the SVM whilst avoiding its principal limitations. Additionally, it typically leads\\nto much sparser models resulting in correspondingly faster performance on test data\\nwhilst maintaining comparable generalization error.\\nIn contrast to the SVM we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to introduce the regres-\\nsion form of the RVM ﬁrst and then consider the extension to classiﬁcation tasks.\\n7.2.1\\nRVM for regression\\nThe relevance vector machine for regression is a linear model of the form studied\\nin Chapter 3 but with a modiﬁed prior that results in sparse solutions.

In the\\nprocess, we will arrive at a signiﬁcantly faster procedure for optimizing the hyper-\\nparameters compared to the direct techniques given above.\\nBefore proceeding with a mathematical analysis, we ﬁrst give some informal\\ninsight into the origin of sparsity in Bayesian linear models. Consider a data set\\ncomprising N = 2 observations t1 and t2, together with a model having a single\\nbasis function φ(x), with hyperparameter α, along with isotropic noise having pre-\\ncision β. From (7.85), the marginal likelihood is given by p(t|α, β) = N(t|0, C) in\\nwhich the covariance matrix takes the form\\nC = 1\\nβ I + 1\\nαϕϕT\\n(7.92)\\nwhere ϕ denotes the N-dimensional vector (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, and similarly t =\\n(t1, t2)T. Notice that this is just a zero-mean Gaussian process model over t with\\ncovariance C. Given a particular observation for t, our goal is to ﬁnd α⋆and β⋆by\\nmaximizing the marginal likelihood. We see from Figure 7.10 that, if there is a poor\\nalignment between the direction of ϕ and that of the training data vector t, then the\\ncorresponding hyperparameter α will be driven to ∞, and the basis vector will be\\npruned from the model. This arises because any ﬁnite value for α will always assign\\na lower probability to the data, thereby decreasing the value of the density at t, pro-\\nvided that β is set to its optimal value. We see that any ﬁnite value for α would cause\\nthe distribution to be elongated in a direction away from the data, thereby increasing\\nthe probability mass in regions away from the observed data and hence reducing the\\nvalue of the density at the target data vector itself.

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\n3. Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophis-\\nticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which\\nunderlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\\nA graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known\\nas edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random\\nvariable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relation-\\nships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint\\ndistribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of\\nfactors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by dis-\\ncussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the\\nlinks of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other\\nmajor class of graphical models are Markov random ﬁelds, also known as undirected\\ngraphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional\\nsigniﬁcance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between\\nrandom variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft con-\\nstraints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems,\\nit is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different\\nrepresentation called a factor graph.\\nIn this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed\\nfor applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treat-\\nments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen\\n(1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999),\\nand Jordan (2007).\\n8.1.

Indeed, one of the powerful\\naspects of graphical models is that a speciﬁc graph can make probabilistic statements\\nfor a broad class of distributions. By application of the product rule of probability\\n(1.11), we can write the joint distribution in the form\\np(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(a, b).\\n(8.1)\\nA second application of the product rule, this time to the second term on the right-\\nhand side of (8.1), gives\\np(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(b|a)p(a).\\n(8.2)\\nNote that this decomposition holds for any choice of the joint distribution.

The joint distribution\\ndeﬁned by a graph is given by the product, over all of the nodes of the graph, of\\na conditional distribution for each node conditioned on the variables corresponding\\nto the parents of that node in the graph. Thus, for a graph with K nodes, the joint\\ndistribution is given by\\np(x) =\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\np(xk|pak)\\n(8.5)\\nwhere pak denotes the set of parents of xk, and x = {x1, . . . , xK}. This key\\nequation expresses the factorization properties of the joint distribution for a directed\\ngraphical model. Although we have considered each node to correspond to a single\\nvariable, we can equally well associate sets of variables and vector-valued variables\\nwith the nodes of a graph. It is easy to show that the representation on the right-\\nhand side of (8.5) is always correctly normalized provided the individual conditional\\ndistributions are normalized.\\nExercise 8.1\\nThe directed graphs that we are considering are subject to an important restric-\\ntion namely that there must be no directed cycles, in other words there are no closed\\npaths within the graph such that we can move from node to node along links follow-\\ning the direction of the arrows and end up back at the starting node. Such graphs are\\nalso called directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. This is equivalent to the statement that\\nExercise 8.2\\nthere exists an ordering of the nodes such that there are no links that go from any\\nnode to any lower numbered node.\\n8.1.1\\nExample: Polynomial regression\\nAs an illustration of the use of directed graphs to describe probability distri-\\nbutions, we consider the Bayesian polynomial regression model introduced in Sec-'),\n",

Although we shall devote the whole of Chapter 11 to a detailed\\ndiscussion of sampling methods, it is instructive to outline here one technique, called\\nancestral sampling, which is particularly relevant to graphical models. Consider a\\njoint distribution p(x1, . . . , xK) over K variables that factorizes according to (8.5)\\ncorresponding to a directed acyclic graph. We shall suppose that the variables have\\nbeen ordered such that there are no links from any node to any lower numbered node,\\nin other words each node has a higher number than any of its parents. Our goal is to\\ndraw a sample \\x01x1, . . . , \\x01xK from the joint distribution.\\nTo do this, we start with the lowest-numbered node and draw a sample from the\\ndistribution p(x1), which we call \\x01x1. We then work through each of the nodes in or-\\nder, so that for node n we draw a sample from the conditional distribution p(xn|pan)\\nin which the parent variables have been set to their sampled values. Note that at each\\nstage, these parent values will always be available because they correspond to lower-\\nnumbered nodes that have already been sampled. Techniques for sampling from\\nspeciﬁc distributions will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Once we have sam-\\npled from the ﬁnal variable xK, we will have achieved our objective of obtaining a\\nsample from the joint distribution. To obtain a sample from some marginal distribu-\\ntion corresponding to a subset of the variables, we simply take the sampled values\\nfor the required nodes and ignore the sampled values for the remaining nodes. For\\nexample, to draw a sample from the distribution p(x2, x4), we simply sample from\\nthe full joint distribution and then retain the values \\x01x2, \\x01x4 and discard the remaining\\nvalues {\\x01xj̸=2,4}.'),\n",

The image (a vector\\nof pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that\\nis dependent on the identity of the object as well as\\non its position and orientation.\\nImage\\nObject\\nOrientation\\nPosition\\nFor practical applications of probabilistic models, it will typically be the higher-\\nnumbered variables corresponding to terminal nodes of the graph that represent the\\nobservations, with lower-numbered nodes corresponding to latent variables. The\\nprimary role of the latent variables is to allow a complicated distribution over the\\nobserved variables to be represented in terms of a model constructed from simpler\\n(typically exponential family) conditional distributions.\\nWe can interpret such models as expressing the processes by which the observed\\ndata arose. For instance, consider an object recognition task in which each observed\\ndata point corresponds to an image (comprising a vector of pixel intensities) of one\\nof the objects. In this case, the latent variables might have an interpretation as the\\nposition and orientation of the object. Given a particular observed image, our goal is\\nto ﬁnd the posterior distribution over objects, in which we integrate over all possible\\npositions and orientations. We can represent this problem using a graphical model\\nof the form show in Figure 8.8.\\nThe graphical model captures the causal process (Pearl, 1988) by which the ob-\\nserved data was generated. For this reason, such models are often called generative\\nmodels.

Two cases are particularly worthy of note,\\nnamely when the parent and child node each correspond to discrete variables and\\nwhen they each correspond to Gaussian variables, because in these two cases the\\nrelationship can be extended hierarchically to construct arbitrarily complex directed\\nacyclic graphs. We begin by examining the discrete case.\\nThe probability distribution p(x|µ) for a single discrete variable x having K\\npossible states (using the 1-of-K representation) is given by\\np(x|µ) =\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\nµxk\\nk\\n(8.9)\\nand is governed by the parameters µ = (µ1, . . . , µK)T.\\nDue to the constraint\\n\\x05\\nk µk = 1, only K −1 values for µk need to be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the\\ndistribution.\\nNow suppose that we have two discrete variables, x1 and x2, each of which has\\nK states, and we wish to model their joint distribution. We denote the probability of\\nobserving both x1k = 1 and x2l = 1 by the parameter µkl, where x1k denotes the\\nkth component of x1, and similarly for x2l. The joint distribution can be written\\np(x1, x2|µ) =\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nl=1\\nµx1kx2l\\nkl\\n.\\nBecause the parameters µkl are subject to the constraint \\x05\\nk\\n\\x05\\nl µkl = 1, this distri-\\nbution is governed by K2 −1 parameters. It is easily seen that the total number of\\nparameters that must be speciﬁed for an arbitrary joint distribution over M variables\\nis KM −1 and therefore grows exponentially with the number M of variables.\\nUsing the product rule, we can factor the joint distribution p(x1, x2) in the form\\np(x2|x1)p(x1), which corresponds to a two-node graph with a link going from the\\nx1 node to the x2 node as shown in Figure 8.9(a). The marginal distribution p(x1)\\nis governed by K −1 parameters, as before, Similarly, the conditional distribution\\np(x2|x1) requires the speciﬁcation of K −1 parameters for each of the K possible\\nvalues of x1. The total number of parameters that must be speciﬁed in the joint\\ndistribution is therefore (K −1) + K(K −1) = K2 −1 as before.\\nNow suppose that the variables x1 and x2 were independent, corresponding to\\nthe graphical model shown in Figure 8.9(b).

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nFigure 8.10\\nThis chain of M discrete nodes, each\\nhaving K states, requires the speciﬁcation of K −1 +\\n(M −1)K(K −1) parameters, which grows linearly\\nwith the length M of the chain. In contrast, a fully con-\\nnected graph of M nodes would have KM −1 param-\\neters, which grows exponentially with M.\\nx1\\nx2\\nxM\\na separate multinomial distribution, and the total number of parameters would be\\n2(K −1). For a distribution over M independent discrete variables, each having K\\nstates, the total number of parameters would be M(K −1), which therefore grows\\nlinearly with the number of variables. From a graphical perspective, we have reduced\\nthe number of parameters by dropping links in the graph, at the expense of having a\\nrestricted class of distributions.\\nMore generally, if we have M discrete variables x1, . . . , xM, we can model\\nthe joint distribution using a directed graph with one variable corresponding to each\\nnode. The conditional distribution at each node is given by a set of nonnegative pa-\\nrameters subject to the usual normalization constraint. If the graph is fully connected\\nthen we have a completely general distribution having KM −1 parameters, whereas\\nif there are no links in the graph the joint distribution factorizes into the product of\\nthe marginals, and the total number of parameters is M(K −1). Graphs having in-\\ntermediate levels of connectivity allow for more general distributions than the fully\\nfactorized one while requiring fewer parameters than the general joint distribution.\\nAs an illustration, consider the chain of nodes shown in Figure 8.10. The marginal\\ndistribution p(x1) requires K −1 parameters, whereas each of the M −1 condi-\\ntional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, requires K(K −1) parameters.\\nThis gives a total parameter count of K −1+(M −1)K(K −1), which is quadratic\\nin K and which grows linearly (rather than exponentially) with the length M of the\\nchain.\\nAn alternative way to reduce the number of independent parameters in a model\\nis by sharing parameters (also known as tying of parameters). For instance, in the\\nchain example of Figure 8.10, we can arrange that all of the conditional distributions\\np(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, are governed by the same set of K(K−1) parameters.\\nTogether with the K−1 parameters governing the distribution of x1, this gives a total\\nof K2 −1 parameters that must be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the joint distribution.\\nWe can turn a graph over discrete variables into a Bayesian model by introduc-\\ning Dirichlet priors for the parameters. From a graphical point of view, each node\\nthen acquires an additional parent representing the Dirichlet distribution over the pa-\\nrameters associated with the corresponding discrete node. This is illustrated for the\\nchain model in Figure 8.11. The corresponding model in which we tie the parame-\\nters governing the conditional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, is shown\\nin Figure 8.12.\\nAnother way of controlling the exponential growth in the number of parameters\\nin models of discrete variables is to use parameterized models for the conditional\\ndistributions instead of complete tables of conditional probability values. To illus-\\ntrate this idea, consider the graph in Figure 8.13 in which all of the nodes represent\\nbinary variables. Each of the parent variables xi is governed by a single parame-'),\n",

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\n8.1.4\\nLinear-Gaussian models\\nIn the previous section, we saw how to construct joint probability distributions\\nover a set of discrete variables by expressing the variables as nodes in a directed\\nacyclic graph. Here we show how a multivariate Gaussian can be expressed as a\\ndirected graph corresponding to a linear-Gaussian model over the component vari-\\nables. This allows us to impose interesting structure on the distribution, with the\\ngeneral Gaussian and the diagonal covariance Gaussian representing opposite ex-\\ntremes. Several widely used techniques are examples of linear-Gaussian models,\\nsuch as probabilistic principal component analysis, factor analysis, and linear dy-\\nnamical systems (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999). We shall make extensive use of\\nthe results of this section in later chapters when we consider some of these techniques\\nin detail.\\nConsider an arbitrary directed acyclic graph over D variables in which node i\\nrepresents a single continuous random variable xi having a Gaussian distribution.\\nThe mean of this distribution is taken to be a linear combination of the states of its\\nparent nodes pai of node i\\np(xi|pai) = N\\n⎛\\n⎝xi\\n\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\n\\x02\\nj∈pai\\nwijxj + bi, vi\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n(8.11)\\nwhere wij and bi are parameters governing the mean, and vi is the variance of the\\nconditional distribution for xi. The log of the joint distribution is then the log of the\\nproduct of these conditionals over all nodes in the graph and hence takes the form\\nln p(x)\\n=\\nD\\n\\x02\\ni=1\\nln p(xi|pai)\\n(8.12)\\n=\\n−\\nD\\n\\x02\\ni=1\\n1\\n2vi\\n⎛\\n⎝xi −\\n\\x02\\nj∈pai\\nwijxj −bi\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n2\\n+ const\\n(8.13)\\nwhere x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x. We see that\\nthis is a quadratic function of the components of x, and hence the joint distribution\\np(x) is a multivariate Gaussian.\\nWe can determine the mean and covariance of the joint distribution recursively\\nas follows. Each variable xi has (conditional on the states of its parents) a Gaussian\\ndistribution of the form (8.11) and so\\nxi =\\n\\x02\\nj∈pai\\nwijxj + bi + √viϵi\\n(8.14)\\nwhere ϵi is a zero mean, unit variance Gaussian random variable satisfying E[ϵi] = 0\\nand E[ϵiϵj] = Iij, where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix.

First of all, suppose that there are no links\\nin the graph, which therefore comprises D isolated nodes. In this case, there are no\\nparameters wij and so there are just D parameters bi and D parameters vi. From\\nthe recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean of p(x) is given by\\n(b1, . . . , bD)T and the covariance matrix is diagonal of the form diag(v1, . . . , vD).\\nThe joint distribution has a total of 2D parameters and represents a set of D inde-\\npendent univariate Gaussian distributions.\\nNow consider a fully connected graph in which each node has all lower num-\\nbered nodes as parents. The matrix wij then has i −1 entries on the ith row and\\nhence is a lower triangular matrix (with no entries on the leading diagonal). Then\\nthe total number of parameters wij is obtained by taking the number D2 of elements\\nin a D ×D matrix, subtracting D to account for the absence of elements on the lead-\\ning diagonal, and then dividing by 2 because the matrix has elements only below the\\ndiagonal, giving a total of D(D−1)/2.

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nWe can readily extend the linear-Gaussian graphical model to the case in which\\nthe nodes of the graph represent multivariate Gaussian variables. In this case, we can\\nwrite the conditional distribution for node i in the form\\np(xi|pai) = N\\n⎛\\n⎝xi\\n\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\x07\\n\\x02\\nj∈pai\\nWijxj + bi, Σi\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n(8.19)\\nwhere now Wij is a matrix (which is nonsquare if xi and xj have different dimen-\\nsionalities). Again it is easy to verify that the joint distribution over all variables is\\nGaussian.\\nNote that we have already encountered a speciﬁc example of the linear-Gaussian\\nrelationship when we saw that the conjugate prior for the mean µ of a Gaussian\\nSection 2.3.6\\nvariable x is itself a Gaussian distribution over µ. The joint distribution over x and\\nµ is therefore Gaussian. This corresponds to a simple two-node graph in which\\nthe node representing µ is the parent of the node representing x. The mean of the\\ndistribution over µ is a parameter controlling a prior, and so it can be viewed as a\\nhyperparameter. Because the value of this hyperparameter may itself be unknown,\\nwe can again treat it from a Bayesian perspective by introducing a prior over the\\nhyperparameter, sometimes called a hyperprior, which is again given by a Gaussian\\ndistribution. This type of construction can be extended in principle to any level and is\\nan illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian model, of which we shall encounter further\\nexamples in later chapters.\\n8.2. Conditional Independence\\nAn important concept for probability distributions over multiple variables is that of\\nconditional independence (Dawid, 1980). Consider three variables a, b, and c, and\\nsuppose that the conditional distribution of a, given b and c, is such that it does not\\ndepend on the value of b, so that\\np(a|b, c) = p(a|c).\\n(8.20)\\nWe say that a is conditionally independent of b given c. This can be expressed in a\\nslightly different way if we consider the joint distribution of a and b conditioned on\\nc, which we can write in the form\\np(a, b|c)\\n=\\np(a|b, c)p(b|c)\\n=\\np(a|c)p(b|c).\\n(8.21)\\nwhere we have used the product rule of probability together with (8.20). Thus we\\nsee that, conditioned on c, the joint distribution of a and b factorizes into the prod-\\nuct of the marginal distribution of a and the marginal distribution of b (again both\\nconditioned on c). This says that the variables a and b are statistically independent,\\ngiven c. Note that our deﬁnition of conditional independence will require that (8.20),'),\n",

An important and elegant feature of graphical models is that conditional\\nindependence properties of the joint distribution can be read directly from the graph\\nwithout having to perform any analytical manipulations.

A formal proof can be found in Lauritzen (1996).\\n8.2.1\\nThree example graphs\\nWe begin our discussion of the conditional independence properties of directed\\ngraphs by considering three simple examples each involving graphs having just three\\nnodes.

When node c is unobserved, it ‘blocks’\\nthe path, and the variables a and b are independent. However, conditioning on c\\n‘unblocks’ the path and renders a and b dependent.\\nThere is one more subtlety associated with this third example that we need to\\nconsider. First we introduce some more terminology. We say that node y is a de-\\nscendant of node x if there is a path from x to y in which each step of the path\\nfollows the directions of the arrows. Then it can be shown that a head-to-head path\\nwill become unblocked if either the node, or any of its descendants, is observed.\\nExercise 8.10\\nIn summary, a tail-to-tail node or a head-to-tail node leaves a path unblocked\\nunless it is observed in which case it blocks the path. By contrast, a head-to-head\\nnode blocks a path if it is unobserved, but once the node, and/or at least one of its\\ndescendants, is observed the path becomes unblocked.\\nIt is worth spending a moment to understand further the unusual behaviour of the\\ngraph of Figure 8.20.

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nand so p(F = 0|G = 0) > p(F = 0). Thus observing that the gauge reads empty\\nmakes it more likely that the tank is indeed empty, as we would intuitively expect.\\nNext suppose that we also check the state of the battery and ﬁnd that it is ﬂat, i.e.,\\nB = 0. We have now observed the states of both the fuel gauge and the battery, as\\nshown by the right-hand graph in Figure 8.21. The posterior probability that the fuel\\ntank is empty given the observations of both the fuel gauge and the battery state is\\nthen given by\\np(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) = p(G = 0|B = 0, F = 0)p(F = 0)\\n\\x05\\nF ∈{0,1} p(G = 0|B = 0, F)p(F) ≃0.111\\n(8.33)\\nwhere the prior probability p(B = 0) has cancelled between numerator and denom-\\ninator. Thus the probability that the tank is empty has decreased (from 0.257 to\\n0.111) as a result of the observation of the state of the battery. This accords with our\\nintuition that ﬁnding out that the battery is ﬂat explains away the observation that the\\nfuel gauge reads empty. We see that the state of the fuel tank and that of the battery\\nhave indeed become dependent on each other as a result of observing the reading\\non the fuel gauge. In fact, this would also be the case if, instead of observing the\\nfuel gauge directly, we observed the state of some descendant of G. Note that the\\nprobability p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) ≃0.111 is greater than the prior probability\\np(F = 0) = 0.1 because the observation that the fuel gauge reads zero still provides\\nsome evidence in favour of an empty fuel tank.\\n8.2.2\\nD-separation\\nWe now give a general statement of the d-separation property (Pearl, 1988) for\\ndirected graphs. Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, and C are arbi-\\ntrary nonintersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete\\nset of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular conditional\\nindependence statement A ⊥⊥B | C is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To\\ndo so, we consider all possible paths from any node in A to any node in B. Any such\\npath is said to be blocked if it includes a node such that either\\n(a) the arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node, and the\\nnode is in the set C, or\\n(b) the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor any of its\\ndescendants, is in the set C.\\nIf all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C, and the joint\\ndistribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy A ⊥⊥B | C.\\nThe concept of d-separation is illustrated in Figure 8.22. In graph (a), the path\\nfrom a to b is not blocked by node f because it is a tail-to-tail node for this path\\nand is not observed, nor is it blocked by node e because, although the latter is a\\nhead-to-head node, it has a descendant c because is in the conditioning set. Thus\\nthe conditional independence statement a ⊥⊥b | c does not follow from this graph.\\nIn graph (b), the path from a to b is blocked by node f because this is a tail-to-tail\\nnode that is observed, and so the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥b | f will'),\n",

Suppose our observed variable consists of a D-dimensional\\nvector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T, and we wish to assign observed values of x to one of K\\nclasses. Using the 1-of-K encoding scheme, we can represent these classes by a K-\\ndimensional binary vector z. We can then deﬁne a generative model by introducing\\na multinomial prior p(z|µ) over the class labels, where the kth component µk of µ\\nis the prior probability of class Ck, together with a conditional distribution p(x|z)\\nfor the observed vector x. The key assumption of the naive Bayes model is that,\\nconditioned on the class z, the distributions of the input variables x1, . . . , xD are in-\\ndependent. The graphical representation of this model is shown in Figure 8.24. We\\nsee that observation of z blocks the path between xi and xj for j ̸= i (because such\\npaths are tail-to-tail at the node z) and so xi and xj are conditionally independent\\ngiven z. If, however, we marginalize out z (so that z is unobserved) the tail-to-tail\\npath from xi to xj is no longer blocked. This tells us that in general the marginal\\ndensity p(x) will not factorize with respect to the components of x. We encountered\\na simple application of the naive Bayes model in the context of fusing data from\\ndifferent sources for medical diagnosis in Section 1.5.\\nIf we are given a labelled training set, comprising inputs {x1, . . . , xN} together\\nwith their class labels, then we can ﬁt the naive Bayes model to the training data'),\n",

It is also useful if the input vector contains both discrete and continuous\\nvariables, since each can be represented separately using appropriate models (e.g.,\\nBernoulli distributions for binary observations or Gaussians for real-valued vari-\\nables). The conditional independence assumption of this model is clearly a strong\\none that may lead to rather poor representations of the class-conditional densities.\\nNevertheless, even if this assumption is not precisely satisﬁed, the model may still\\ngive good classiﬁcation performance in practice because the decision boundaries can\\nbe insensitive to some of the details in the class-conditional densities, as illustrated\\nin Figure 1.27.\\nWe have seen that a particular directed graph represents a speciﬁc decomposition\\nof a joint probability distribution into a product of conditional probabilities.

Alternatively, we can use the graph as\\na different kind of ﬁlter by ﬁrst listing all of the conditional independence properties\\nobtained by applying the d-separation criterion to the graph, and then allowing a\\ndistribution to pass only if it satisﬁes all of these properties.

Markov Random Fields\\n385\\nFigure 8.28\\nFor an undirected graph, the Markov blanket of a node\\nxi consists of the set of neighbouring nodes. It has the\\nproperty that the conditional distribution of xi, conditioned\\non all the remaining variables in the graph, is dependent\\nonly on the variables in the Markov blanket.\\nIf we consider two nodes xi and xj that are not connected by a link, then these\\nvariables must be conditionally independent given all other nodes in the graph. This\\nfollows from the fact that there is no direct path between the two nodes, and all other\\npaths pass through nodes that are observed, and hence those paths are blocked. This\\nconditional independence property can be expressed as\\np(xi, xj|x\\\\{i,j}) = p(xi|x\\\\{i,j})p(xj|x\\\\{i,j})\\n(8.38)\\nwhere x\\\\{i,j} denotes the set x of all variables with xi and xj removed. The factor-\\nization of the joint distribution must therefore be such that xi and xj do not appear\\nin the same factor in order for the conditional independence property to hold for all\\npossible distributions belonging to the graph.\\nThis leads us to consider a graphical concept called a clique, which is deﬁned\\nas a subset of the nodes in a graph such that there exists a link between all pairs of\\nnodes in the subset. In other words, the set of nodes in a clique is fully connected.\\nFurthermore, a maximal clique is a clique such that it is not possible to include any\\nother nodes from the graph in the set without it ceasing to be a clique. These concepts\\nare illustrated by the undirected graph over four variables shown in Figure 8.29. This\\ngraph has ﬁve cliques of two nodes given by {x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, {x3, x4}, {x4, x2},\\nand {x1, x3}, as well as two maximal cliques given by {x1, x2, x3} and {x2, x3, x4}.\\nThe set {x1, x2, x3, x4} is not a clique because of the missing link from x1 to x4.\\nWe can therefore deﬁne the factors in the decomposition of the joint distribution\\nto be functions of the variables in the cliques. In fact, we can consider functions\\nof the maximal cliques, without loss of generality, because other cliques must be\\nsubsets of maximal cliques. Thus, if {x1, x2, x3} is a maximal clique and we deﬁne\\nan arbitrary function over this clique, then including another factor deﬁned over a\\nsubset of these variables would be redundant.\\nLet us denote a clique by C and the set of variables in that clique by xC.

In (8.40) we have assumed that x comprises discrete variables, but the\\nframework is equally applicable to continuous variables, or a combination of the two,\\nin which the summation is replaced by the appropriate combination of summation\\nand integration.\\nNote that we do not restrict the choice of potential functions to those that have a\\nspeciﬁc probabilistic interpretation as marginal or conditional distributions. This is\\nin contrast to directed graphs in which each factor represents the conditional distribu-\\ntion of the corresponding variable, conditioned on the state of its parents. However,\\nin special cases, for instance where the undirected graph is constructed by starting\\nwith a directed graph, the potential functions may indeed have such an interpretation,\\nas we shall see shortly.\\nOne consequence of the generality of the potential functions ψC(xC) is that\\ntheir product will in general not be correctly normalized. We therefore have to in-\\ntroduce an explicit normalization factor given by (8.40). Recall that for directed\\ngraphs, the joint distribution was automatically normalized as a consequence of the\\nnormalization of each of the conditional distributions in the factorization.\\nThe presence of this normalization constant is one of the major limitations of\\nundirected graphs. If we have a model with M discrete nodes each having K states,\\nthen the evaluation of the normalization term involves summing over KM states and\\nso (in the worst case) is exponential in the size of the model. The partition function\\nis needed for parameter learning because it will be a function of any parameters that\\ngovern the potential functions ψC(xC). However, for evaluation of local conditional\\ndistributions, the partition function is not needed because a conditional is the ratio\\nof two marginals, and the partition function cancels between numerator and denom-\\ninator when evaluating this ratio. Similarly, for evaluating local marginal probabil-\\nities we can work with the unnormalized joint distribution and then normalize the\\nmarginals explicitly at the end. Provided the marginals only involves a small number\\nof variables, the evaluation of their normalization coefﬁcient will be feasible.\\nSo far, we have discussed the notion of conditional independence based on sim-\\nple graph separation and we have proposed a factorization of the joint distribution\\nthat is intended to correspond to this conditional independence structure. However,\\nwe have not made any formal connection between conditional independence and\\nfactorization for undirected graphs. To do so we need to restrict attention to poten-\\ntial functions ψC(xC) that are strictly positive (i.e., never zero or negative for any'),\n",

Similarly, we can deﬁne UF to be the set of such distributions that can\\nbe expressed as a factorization of the form (8.39) with respect to the maximal cliques\\nof the graph. The Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Clifford, 1990) states that the sets\\nUI and UF are identical.\\nBecause we are restricted to potential functions which are strictly positive it is\\nconvenient to express them as exponentials, so that\\nψC(xC) = exp {−E(xC)}\\n(8.41)\\nwhere E(xC) is called an energy function, and the exponential representation is\\ncalled the Boltzmann distribution. The joint distribution is deﬁned as the product of\\npotentials, and so the total energy is obtained by adding the energies of each of the\\nmaximal cliques.\\nIn contrast to the factors in the joint distribution for a directed graph, the po-\\ntentials in an undirected graph do not have a speciﬁc probabilistic interpretation.\\nAlthough this gives greater ﬂexibility in choosing the potential functions, because\\nthere is no normalization constraint, it does raise the question of how to motivate a\\nchoice of potential function for a particular application. This can be done by view-\\ning the potential function as expressing which conﬁgurations of the local variables\\nare preferred to others.

We shall suppose\\nthat the image is obtained by taking an unknown noise-free image, described by\\nbinary pixel values xi ∈{−1, +1} and randomly ﬂipping the sign of pixels with\\nsome small probability. An example binary image, together with a noise corrupted\\nimage obtained by ﬂipping the sign of the pixels with probability 10%, is shown in\\nFigure 8.30. Given the noisy image, our goal is to recover the original noise-free\\nimage.\\nBecause the noise level is small, we know that there will be a strong correlation\\nbetween xi and yi.

Consider a simple directed graph over 4 nodes shown in Figure 8.33.\\nThe joint distribution for the directed graph takes the form\\np(x) = p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3).\\n(8.46)\\nWe see that the factor p(x4|x1, x2, x3) involves the four variables x1, x2, x3, and\\nx4, and so these must all belong to a single clique if this conditional distribution is\\nto be absorbed into a clique potential. To ensure this, we add extra links between\\nall pairs of parents of the node x4. Anachronistically, this process of ‘marrying\\nthe parents’ has become known as moralization, and the resulting undirected graph,\\nafter dropping the arrows, is called the moral graph. It is important to observe that\\nthe moral graph in this example is fully connected and so exhibits no conditional\\nindependence properties, in contrast to the original directed graph.\\nThus in general to convert a directed graph into an undirected graph, we ﬁrst add\\nadditional undirected links between all pairs of parents for each node in the graph and'),\n",

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nNow suppose we wish to evaluate the marginals p(xn) for every node n ∈\\n{1, . . . , N} in the chain. Simply applying the above procedure separately for each\\nnode will have computational cost that is O(N 2M 2). However, such an approach\\nwould be very wasteful of computation. For instance, to ﬁnd p(x1) we need to prop-\\nagate a message µβ(·) from node xN back to node x2. Similarly, to evaluate p(x2)\\nwe need to propagate a messages µβ(·) from node xN back to node x3. This will\\ninvolve much duplicated computation because most of the messages will be identical\\nin the two cases.\\nSuppose instead we ﬁrst launch a message µβ(xN−1) starting from node xN\\nand propagate corresponding messages all the way back to node x1, and suppose we\\nsimilarly launch a message µα(x2) starting from node x1 and propagate the corre-\\nsponding messages all the way forward to node xN. Provided we store all of the\\nintermediate messages along the way, then any node can evaluate its marginal sim-\\nply by applying (8.54). The computational cost is only twice that for ﬁnding the\\nmarginal of a single node, rather than N times as much. Observe that a message\\nhas passed once in each direction across each link in the graph. Note also that the\\nnormalization constant Z need be evaluated only once, using any convenient node.\\nIf some of the nodes in the graph are observed, then the corresponding variables\\nare simply clamped to their observed values and there is no summation. To see\\nthis, note that the effect of clamping a variable xn to an observed value \\x01xn can\\nbe expressed by multiplying the joint distribution by (one or more copies of) an\\nadditional function I(xn, \\x01xn), which takes the value 1 when xn = \\x01xn and the value\\n0 otherwise. One such function can then be absorbed into each of the potentials that\\ncontain xn. Summations over xn then contain only one term in which xn = \\x01xn.\\nNow suppose we wish to calculate the joint distribution p(xn−1, xn) for two\\nneighbouring nodes on the chain. This is similar to the evaluation of the marginal\\nfor a single node, except that there are now two variables that are not summed out.\\nA few moments thought will show that the required joint distribution can be written\\nExercise 8.15\\nin the form\\np(xn−1, xn) = 1\\nZ µα(xn−1)ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)µβ(xn).\\n(8.58)\\nThus we can obtain the joint distributions over all of the sets of variables in each\\nof the potentials directly once we have completed the message passing required to\\nobtain the marginals.\\nThis is a useful result because in practice we may wish to use parametric forms\\nfor the clique potentials, or equivalently for the conditional distributions if we started\\nfrom a directed graph. In order to learn the parameters of these potentials in situa-\\ntions where not all of the variables are observed, we can employ the EM algorithm,\\nChapter 9\\nand it turns out that the local joint distributions of the cliques, conditioned on any\\nobserved data, is precisely what is needed in the E step. We shall consider some\\nexamples of this in detail in Chapter 13.\\n8.4.2\\nTrees\\nWe have seen that exact inference on a graph comprising a chain of nodes can be\\nperformed efﬁciently in time that is linear in the number of nodes, using an algorithm'),\n",

Such graphs therefore do not\\nhave loops. In the case of directed graphs, a tree is deﬁned such that there is a single\\nnode, called the root, which has no parents, and all other nodes have one parent. If\\nwe convert a directed tree into an undirected graph, we see that the moralization step\\nwill not add any links as all nodes have at most one parent, and as a consequence the\\ncorresponding moralized graph will be an undirected tree. Examples of undirected\\nand directed trees are shown in Figure 8.39(a) and 8.39(b). Note that a distribution\\nrepresented as a directed tree can easily be converted into one represented by an\\nundirected tree, and vice versa.\\nExercise 8.18\\nIf there are nodes in a directed graph that have more than one parent, but there is\\nstill only one path (ignoring the direction of the arrows) between any two nodes, then\\nthe graph is a called a polytree, as illustrated in Figure 8.39(c).

Inference in Graphical Models\\n407\\nas illustrated in Figure 8.49(b).\\nAt this point, it is worth pausing to summarize the particular version of the sum-\\nproduct algorithm obtained so far for evaluating the marginal p(x). We start by\\nviewing the variable node x as the root of the factor graph and initiating messages\\nat the leaves of the graph using (8.70) and (8.71). The message passing steps (8.66)\\nand (8.69) are then applied recursively until messages have been propagated along\\nevery link, and the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours. Each\\nnode can send a message towards the root once it has received messages from all\\nof its other neighbours. Once the root node has received messages from all of its\\nneighbours, the required marginal can be evaluated using (8.63). We shall illustrate\\nthis process shortly.\\nTo see that each node will always receive enough messages to be able to send out\\na message, we can use a simple inductive argument as follows. Clearly, for a graph\\ncomprising a variable root node connected directly to several factor leaf nodes, the\\nalgorithm trivially involves sending messages of the form (8.71) directly from the\\nleaves to the root. Now imagine building up a general graph by adding nodes one at\\na time, and suppose that for some particular graph we have a valid algorithm. When\\none more (variable or factor) node is added, it can be connected only by a single\\nlink because the overall graph must remain a tree, and so the new node will be a leaf\\nnode. It therefore sends a message to the node to which it is linked, which in turn\\nwill therefore receive all the messages it requires in order to send its own message\\ntowards the root, and so again we have a valid algorithm, thereby completing the\\nproof.\\nNow suppose we wish to ﬁnd the marginals for every variable node in the graph.\\nThis could be done by simply running the above algorithm afresh for each such node.\\nHowever, this would be very wasteful as many of the required computations would\\nbe repeated. We can obtain a much more efﬁcient procedure by ‘overlaying’ these\\nmultiple message passing algorithms to obtain the general sum-product algorithm\\nas follows. Arbitrarily pick any (variable or factor) node and designate it as the\\nroot. Propagate messages from the leaves to the root as before. At this point, the\\nroot node will have received messages from all of its neighbours. It can therefore\\nsend out messages to all of its neighbours. These in turn will then have received\\nmessages from all of their neighbours and so can send out messages along the links\\ngoing away from the root, and so on. In this way, messages are passed outwards\\nfrom the root all the way to the leaves. By now, a message will have passed in\\nboth directions across every link in the graph, and every node will have received\\na message from all of its neighbours. Again a simple inductive argument can be\\nused to verify the validity of this message passing protocol. Because every variable\\nExercise 8.20\\nnode will have received messages from all of its neighbours, we can readily calculate\\nthe marginal distribution for every variable in the graph. The number of messages\\nthat have to be computed is given by twice the number of links in the graph and\\nso involves only twice the computation involved in ﬁnding a single marginal. By\\ncomparison, if we had run the sum-product algorithm separately for each node, the\\namount of computation would grow quadratically with the size of the graph. Note\\nthat this algorithm is in fact independent of which node was designated as the root,'),\n",

If the factors are\\nparameterized functions and we wish to learn the values of the parameters using\\nthe EM algorithm, then these marginals are precisely the quantities we will need to\\ncalculate in the E step, as we shall see in detail when we discuss the hidden Markov\\nmodel in Chapter 13.\\nThe message sent by a variable node to a factor node, as we have seen, is simply\\nthe product of the incoming messages on other links. We can if we wish view the\\nsum-product algorithm in a slightly different form by eliminating messages from\\nvariable nodes to factor nodes and simply considering messages that are sent out by\\nfactor nodes. This is most easily seen by considering the example in Figure 8.50.\\nSo far, we have rather neglected the issue of normalization. If the factor graph\\nwas derived from a directed graph, then the joint distribution is already correctly nor-\\nmalized, and so the marginals obtained by the sum-product algorithm will similarly\\nbe normalized correctly. However, if we started from an undirected graph, then in\\ngeneral there will be an unknown normalization coefﬁcient 1/Z. As with the simple\\nchain example of Figure 8.38, this is easily handled by working with an unnormal-\\nized version \\x04p(x) of the joint distribution, where p(x) = \\x04p(x)/Z. We ﬁrst run the\\nsum-product algorithm to ﬁnd the corresponding unnormalized marginals \\x04p(xi). The\\ncoefﬁcient 1/Z is then easily obtained by normalizing any one of these marginals,\\nand this is computationally efﬁcient because the normalization is done over a single\\nvariable rather than over the entire set of variables as would be required to normalize\\n\\x04p(x) directly.\\nAt this point, it may be helpful to consider a simple example to illustrate the\\noperation of the sum-product algorithm. Figure 8.51 shows a simple 4-node factor'),\n",

Two\\nother common tasks are to ﬁnd a setting of the variables that has the largest prob-\\nability and to ﬁnd the value of that probability. These can be addressed through a\\nclosely related algorithm called max-sum, which can be viewed as an application of\\ndynamic programming in the context of graphical models (Cormen et al., 2001).\\nA simple approach to ﬁnding latent variable values having high probability\\nwould be to run the sum-product algorithm to obtain the marginals p(xi) for ev-\\nery variable, and then, for each marginal in turn, to ﬁnd the value x⋆\\ni that maximizes\\nthat marginal. However, this would give the set of values that are individually the\\nmost probable. In practice, we typically wish to ﬁnd the set of values that jointly\\nhave the largest probability, in other words the vector xmax that maximizes the joint\\ndistribution, so that\\nxmax = arg max\\nx\\np(x)\\n(8.87)\\nfor which the corresponding value of the joint probability will be given by\\np(xmax) = max\\nx\\np(x).\\n(8.88)\\nIn general, xmax is not the same as the set of x⋆\\ni values, as we can easily show using\\na simple example. Consider the joint distribution p(x, y) over two binary variables\\nx, y ∈{0, 1} given in Table 8.1. The joint distribution is maximized by setting x =\\n1 and y = 0, corresponding the value 0.4. However, the marginal for p(x), obtained\\nby summing over both values of y, is given by p(x = 0) = 0.6 and p(x = 1) = 0.4,\\nand similarly the marginal for y is given by p(y = 0) = 0.7 and p(y = 1) = 0.3,\\nand so the marginals are maximized by x = 0 and y = 0, which corresponds to a\\nvalue of 0.3 for the joint distribution. In fact, it is not difﬁcult to construct examples\\nfor which the set of individually most probable values has probability zero under the\\njoint distribution.\\nExercise 8.27\\nWe therefore seek an efﬁcient algorithm for ﬁnding the value of x that maxi-\\nmizes the joint distribution p(x) and that will allow us to obtain the value of the\\njoint distribution at its maximum. To address the second of these problems, we shall\\nsimply write out the max operator in terms of its components\\nmax\\nx\\np(x) = max\\nx1 . . . max\\nxM p(x)\\n(8.89)'),\n",

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nwhere M is the total number of variables, and then substitute for p(x) using its\\nexpansion in terms of a product of factors.

Here we make use of\\nthe analogous law for the max operator\\nmax(ab, ac) = a max(b, c)\\n(8.90)\\nwhich holds if a ⩾0 (as will always be the case for the factors in a graphical model).\\nThis allows us to exchange products with maximizations.\\nConsider ﬁrst the simple example of a chain of nodes described by (8.49). The\\nevaluation of the probability maximum can be written as\\nmax\\nx\\np(x) = 1\\nZ max\\nx1 · · · max\\nxN [ψ1,2(x1, x2) · · · ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN)]\\n=\\n1\\nZ max\\nx1\\n\\x1d\\nψ1,2(x1, x2)\\n\\x1d\\n· · · max\\nxN ψN−1,N(xN−1, xN)\\n\\x1e\\x1e\\n.\\nAs with the calculation of marginals, we see that exchanging the max and product\\noperators results in a much more efﬁcient computation, and one that is easily inter-\\npreted in terms of messages passed from node xN backwards along the chain to node\\nx1.\\nWe can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured factor graphs\\nby substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor graph expansion into (8.89) and\\nagain exchanging maximizations with products. The structure of this calculation is\\nidentical to that of the sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those\\nresults into the present context. In particular, suppose that we designate a particular\\nvariable node as the ‘root’ of the graph. Then we start a set of messages propagating\\ninwards from the leaves of the tree towards the root, with each node sending its\\nmessage towards the root once it has received all incoming messages from its other\\nneighbours. The ﬁnal maximization is performed over the product of all messages\\narriving at the root node, and gives the maximum value for p(x). This could be called\\nthe max-product algorithm and is identical to the sum-product algorithm except that\\nsummations are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage, messages have\\nbeen sent from leaves to the root, but not in the other direction.\\nIn practice, products of many small probabilities can lead to numerical under-\\nﬂow problems, and so it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the joint distri-\\nbution. The logarithm is a monotonic function, so that if a > b then ln a > ln b, and\\nhence the max operator and the logarithm function can be interchanged, so that\\nln\\n\\x11\\nmax\\nx\\np(x)\\n\\x12\\n= max\\nx\\nln p(x).\\n(8.91)\\nThe distributive property is preserved because\\nmax(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c).\\n(8.92)\\nThus taking the logarithm simply has the effect of replacing the products in the\\nmax-product algorithm with sums, and so we obtain the max-sum algorithm.

Once we know the most probable value of the ﬁ-\\nnal node xN, we can then simply follow the link back to ﬁnd the most probable state\\nof node xN−1 and so on back to the initial node x1. This corresponds to propagating\\na message back down the chain using\\nxmax\\nn−1 = φ(xmax\\nn\\n)\\n(8.102)\\nand is known as back-tracking. Note that there could be several values of xn−1 all\\nof which give the maximum value in (8.101). Provided we chose one of these values\\nwhen we do the back-tracking, we are assured of a globally consistent maximizing\\nconﬁguration.\\nIn Figure 8.53, we have indicated two paths, each of which we shall suppose\\ncorresponds to a global maximum of the joint probability distribution. If k = 2\\nand k = 3 each represent possible values of xmax\\nN\\n, then starting from either state\\nand tracing back along the black lines, which corresponds to iterating (8.102), we\\nobtain a valid global maximum conﬁguration. Note that if we had run a forward\\npass of max-sum message passing followed by a backward pass and then applied\\n(8.98) at each node separately, we could end up selecting some states from one path\\nand some from the other path, giving an overall conﬁguration that is not a global\\nmaximizer. We see that it is necessary instead to keep track of the maximizing states\\nduring the forward pass using the functions φ(xn) and then use back-tracking to ﬁnd\\na consistent solution.\\nThe extension to a general tree-structured factor graph should now be clear. If\\na message is sent from a factor node f to a variable node x, a maximization is\\nperformed over all other variable nodes x1, . . . , xM that are neighbours of that fac-\\ntor node, using (8.93). When we perform this maximization, we keep a record of\\nwhich values of the variables x1, . . . , xM gave rise to the maximum. Then in the\\nback-tracking step, having found xmax, we can then use these stored values to as-\\nsign consistent maximizing states xmax\\n1\\n, . . . , xmax\\nM . The max-sum algorithm, with\\nback-tracking, gives an exact maximizing conﬁguration for the variables provided\\nthe factor graph is a tree. An important application of this technique is for ﬁnding\\nthe most probable sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model, in which\\ncase it is known as the Viterbi algorithm.\\nSection 13.2\\nAs with the sum-product algorithm, the inclusion of evidence in the form of\\nobserved variables is straightforward. The observed variables are clamped to their\\nobserved values, and the maximization is performed over the remaining hidden vari-\\nables. This can be shown formally by including identity functions for the observed\\nvariables into the factor functions, as we did for the sum-product algorithm.\\nIt is interesting to compare max-sum with the iterated conditional modes (ICM)\\nalgorithm described on page 389. Each step in ICM is computationally simpler be-\\ncause the ‘messages’ that are passed from one node to the next comprise a single\\nvalue consisting of the new state of the node for which the conditional distribution\\nis maximized. The max-sum algorithm is more complex because the messages are\\nfunctions of node variables x and hence comprise a set of K values for each pos-\\nsible state of x.

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\n8.4.6\\nExact inference in general graphs\\nThe sum-product and max-sum algorithms provide efﬁcient and exact solutions\\nto inference problems in tree-structured graphs. For many practical applications,\\nhowever, we have to deal with graphs having loops.\\nThe message passing framework can be generalized to arbitrary graph topolo-\\ngies, giving an exact inference procedure known as the junction tree algorithm (Lau-\\nritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Jordan, 2007). Here we give a brief outline of the\\nkey steps involved. This is not intended to convey a detailed understanding of the\\nalgorithm, but rather to give a ﬂavour of the various stages involved. If the starting\\npoint is a directed graph, it is ﬁrst converted to an undirected graph by moraliza-\\ntion, whereas if starting from an undirected graph this step is not required. Next the\\ngraph is triangulated, which involves ﬁnding chord-less cycles containing four or\\nmore nodes and adding extra links to eliminate such chord-less cycles. For instance,\\nin the graph in Figure 8.36, the cycle A–C–B–D–A is chord-less a link could be\\nadded between A and B or alternatively between C and D. Note that the joint dis-\\ntribution for the resulting triangulated graph is still deﬁned by a product of the same\\npotential functions, but these are now considered to be functions over expanded sets\\nof variables. Next the triangulated graph is used to construct a new tree-structured\\nundirected graph called a join tree, whose nodes correspond to the maximal cliques\\nof the triangulated graph, and whose links connect pairs of cliques that have vari-\\nables in common. The selection of which pairs of cliques to connect in this way is\\nimportant and is done so as to give a maximal spanning tree deﬁned as follows. Of\\nall possible trees that link up the cliques, the one that is chosen is one for which the\\nweight of the tree is largest, where the weight for a link is the number of nodes shared\\nby the two cliques it connects, and the weight for the tree is the sum of the weights\\nfor the links. If the tree is condensed, so that any clique that is a subset of another\\nclique is absorbed into the larger clique, this gives a junction tree. As a consequence\\nof the triangulation step, the resulting tree satisﬁes the running intersection property,\\nwhich means that if a variable is contained in two cliques, then it must also be con-\\ntained in every clique on the path that connects them. This ensures that inference\\nabout variables will be consistent across the graph. Finally, a two-stage message\\npassing algorithm, essentially equivalent to the sum-product algorithm, can now be\\napplied to this junction tree in order to ﬁnd marginals and conditionals. Although\\nthe junction tree algorithm sounds complicated, at its heart is the simple idea that\\nwe have used already of exploiting the factorization properties of the distribution to\\nallow sums and products to be interchanged so that partial summations can be per-\\nformed, thereby avoiding having to work directly with the joint distribution. The\\nrole of the junction tree is to provide a precise and efﬁcient way to organize these\\ncomputations. It is worth emphasizing that this is achieved using purely graphical\\noperations!\\nThe junction tree is exact for arbitrary graphs and is efﬁcient in the sense that\\nfor a given graph there does not in general exist a computationally cheaper approach.\\nUnfortunately, the algorithm must work with the joint distributions within each node\\n(each of which corresponds to a clique of the triangulated graph) and so the compu-\\ntational cost of the algorithm is determined by the number of variables in the largest'),\n",

In fact, it is deﬁned to\\nbe as one less than the size of the largest clique, to ensure that a tree has a treewidth\\nof 1. Because there in general there can be multiple different junction trees that can\\nbe constructed from a given starting graph, the treewidth is deﬁned by the junction\\ntree for which the largest clique has the fewest variables. If the treewidth of the\\noriginal graph is high, the junction tree algorithm becomes impractical.\\n8.4.7\\nLoopy belief propagation\\nFor many problems of practical interest, it will not be feasible to use exact in-\\nference, and so we need to exploit effective approximation methods. An important\\nclass of such approximations, that can broadly be called variational methods, will be\\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 10. Complementing these deterministic approaches is\\na wide range of sampling methods, also called Monte Carlo methods, that are based\\non stochastic numerical sampling from distributions and that will be discussed at\\nlength in Chapter 11.\\nHere we consider one simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with\\nloops, which builds directly on the previous discussion of exact inference in trees.\\nThe idea is simply to apply the sum-product algorithm even though there is no guar-\\nantee that it will yield good results. This approach is known as loopy belief propa-\\ngation (Frey and MacKay, 1998) and is possible because the message passing rules\\n(8.66) and (8.69) for the sum-product algorithm are purely local. However, because\\nthe graph now has cycles, information can ﬂow many times around the graph. For\\nsome models, the algorithm will converge, whereas for others it will not.\\nIn order to apply this approach, we need to deﬁne a message passing schedule.\\nLet us assume that one message is passed at a time on any given link and in any\\ngiven direction. Each message sent from a node replaces any previous message sent\\nin the same direction across the same link and will itself be a function only of the\\nmost recent messages received by that node at previous steps of the algorithm.\\nWe have seen that a message can only be sent across a link from a node when\\nall other messages have been received by that node across its other links. Because\\nthere are loops in the graph, this raises the problem of how to initiate the message\\npassing algorithm. To resolve this, we suppose that an initial message given by the\\nunit function has been passed across every link in each direction. Every node is then\\nin a position to send a message.\\nThere are now many possible ways to organize the message passing schedule.\\nFor example, the ﬂooding schedule simultaneously passes a message across every\\nlink in both directions at each time step, whereas schedules that pass one message at\\na time are called serial schedules.\\nFollowing Kschischnang et al. (2001), we will say that a (variable or factor)\\nnode a has a message pending on its link to a node b if node a has received any\\nmessage on any of its other links since the last time it send a message to b. Thus,\\nwhen a node receives a message on one of its links, this creates pending messages\\non all of its other links. Only pending messages need to be transmitted because'),\n",

GRAPHICAL MODELS\\nother messages would simply duplicate the previous message on the same link. For\\ngraphs that have a tree structure, any schedule that sends only pending messages\\nwill eventually terminate once a message has passed in each direction across every\\nlink. At this point, there are no pending messages, and the product of the received\\nExercise 8.29\\nmessages at every variable give the exact marginal. In graphs having loops, however,\\nthe algorithm may never terminate because there might always be pending messages,\\nalthough in practice it is generally found to converge within a reasonable time for\\nmost applications. Once the algorithm has converged, or once it has been stopped\\nif convergence is not observed, the (approximate) local marginals can be computed\\nusing the product of the most recently received incoming messages to each variable\\nnode or factor node on every link.\\nIn some applications, the loopy belief propagation algorithm can give poor re-\\nsults, whereas in other applications it has proven to be very effective. In particular,\\nstate-of-the-art algorithms for decoding certain kinds of error-correcting codes are\\nequivalent to loopy belief propagation (Gallager, 1963; Berrou et al., 1993; McEliece\\net al., 1998; MacKay and Neal, 1999; Frey, 1998).\\n8.4.8\\nLearning the graph structure\\nIn our discussion of inference in graphical models, we have assumed that the\\nstructure of the graph is known and ﬁxed. However, there is also interest in go-\\ning beyond the inference problem and learning the graph structure itself from data\\n(Friedman and Koller, 2003). This requires that we deﬁne a space of possible struc-\\ntures as well as a measure that can be used to score each structure.\\nFrom a Bayesian viewpoint, we would ideally like to compute a posterior dis-\\ntribution over graph structures and to make predictions by averaging with respect\\nto this distribution. If we have a prior p(m) over graphs indexed by m, then the\\nposterior distribution is given by\\np(m|D) ∝p(m)p(D|m)\\n(8.103)\\nwhere D is the observed data set. The model evidence p(D|m) then provides the\\nscore for each model. However, evaluation of the evidence involves marginalization\\nover the latent variables and presents a challenging computational problem for many\\nmodels.\\nExploring the space of structures can also be problematic. Because the number\\nof different graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, it is\\noften necessary to resort to heuristics to ﬁnd good candidates.\\nExercises\\n8.1\\n(⋆) www\\nBy marginalizing out the variables in order, show that the representation\\n(8.5) for the joint distribution of a directed graph is correctly normalized, provided\\neach of the conditional distributions is normalized.\\n8.2\\n(⋆) www\\nShow that the property of there being no directed cycles in a directed\\ngraph follows from the statement that there exists an ordered numbering of the nodes\\nsuch that for each node there are no links going to a lower-numbered node.'),\n",

In many applications, their parameters are\\ndetermined by maximum likelihood, typically using the EM algorithm. However, as\\nwe shall see there are some signiﬁcant limitations to the maximum likelihood ap-\\nproach, and in Chapter 10 we shall show that an elegant Bayesian treatment can be\\ngiven using the framework of variational inference. This requires little additional\\ncomputation compared with EM, and it resolves the principal difﬁculties of maxi-\\nmum likelihood while also allowing the number of components in the mixture to be\\ninferred automatically from the data.\\n9.1. K-means Clustering\\nWe begin by considering the problem of identifying groups, or clusters, of data points\\nin a multidimensional space. Suppose we have a data set {x1, . . . , xN} consisting\\nof N observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable x. Our goal is to\\npartition the data set into some number K of clusters, where we shall suppose for\\nthe moment that the value of K is given. Intuitively, we might think of a cluster as\\ncomprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared\\nwith the distances to points outside of the cluster. We can formalize this notion by\\nﬁrst introducing a set of D-dimensional vectors µk, where k = 1, . . . , K, in which\\nµk is a prototype associated with the kth cluster. As we shall see shortly, we can\\nthink of the µk as representing the centres of the clusters. Our goal is then to ﬁnd\\nan assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors {µk}, such that\\nthe sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest vector µk, is\\na minimum.\\nIt is convenient at this point to deﬁne some notation to describe the assignment\\nof data points to clusters. For each data point xn, we introduce a corresponding set\\nof binary indicator variables rnk ∈{0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K describing which of\\nthe K clusters the data point xn is assigned to, so that if data point xn is assigned to\\ncluster k then rnk = 1, and rnj = 0 for j ̸= k. This is known as the 1-of-K coding\\nscheme. We can then deﬁne an objective function, sometimes called a distortion\\nmeasure, given by\\nJ =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nrnk∥xn −µk∥2\\n(9.1)\\nwhich represents the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its'),\n",

We can do this through an iterative procedure in which each iteration\\ninvolves two successive steps corresponding to successive optimizations with respect\\nto the rnk and the µk. First we choose some initial values for the µk. Then in the ﬁrst\\nphase we minimize J with respect to the rnk, keeping the µk ﬁxed. In the second\\nphase we minimize J with respect to the µk, keeping rnk ﬁxed. This two-stage\\noptimization is then repeated until convergence. We shall see that these two stages\\nof updating rnk and updating µk correspond respectively to the E (expectation) and\\nM (maximization) steps of the EM algorithm, and to emphasize this we shall use the\\nSection 9.4\\nterms E step and M step in the context of the K-means algorithm.\\nConsider ﬁrst the determination of the rnk. Because J in (9.1) is a linear func-\\ntion of rnk, this optimization can be performed easily to give a closed form solution.\\nThe terms involving different n are independent and so we can optimize for each\\nn separately by choosing rnk to be 1 for whichever value of k gives the minimum\\nvalue of ∥xn −µk∥2. In other words, we simply assign the nth data point to the\\nclosest cluster centre. More formally, this can be expressed as\\nrnk =\\n\\x0c1\\nif k = arg minj ∥xn −µj∥2\\n0\\notherwise.\\n(9.2)\\nNow consider the optimization of the µk with the rnk held ﬁxed. The objective\\nfunction J is a quadratic function of µk, and it can be minimized by setting its\\nderivative with respect to µk to zero giving\\n2\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nrnk(xn −µk) = 0\\n(9.3)\\nwhich we can easily solve for µk to give\\nµk =\\n\\x05\\nn rnkxn\\n\\x05\\nn rnk\\n.\\n(9.4)\\nThe denominator in this expression is equal to the number of points assigned to\\ncluster k, and so this result has a simple interpretation, namely set µk equal to the\\nmean of all of the data points xn assigned to cluster k. For this reason, the procedure\\nis known as the K-means algorithm.\\nThe two phases of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the clus-\\nter means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments (or\\nuntil some maximum number of iterations is exceeded). Because each phase reduces\\nthe value of the objective function J, convergence of the algorithm is assured. How-\\nExercise 9.1\\never, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of J. The convergence\\nproperties of the K-means algorithm were studied by MacQueen (1967).\\nThe K-means algorithm is illustrated using the Old Faithful data set in Fig-\\nAppendix A\\nure 9.1.

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM\\nbut it can also make the determination of the cluster means nonrobust to outliers. We\\nSection 2.3.7\\ncan generalize the K-means algorithm by introducing a more general dissimilarity\\nmeasure V(x, x′) between two vectors x and x′ and then minimizing the following\\ndistortion measure\\n\\x04J =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nrnkV(xn, µk)\\n(9.6)\\nwhich gives the K-medoids algorithm. The E step again involves, for given cluster\\nprototypes µk, assigning each data point to the cluster for which the dissimilarity to\\nthe corresponding prototype is smallest. The computational cost of this is O(KN),\\nas is the case for the standard K-means algorithm. For a general choice of dissimi-\\nlarity measure, the M step is potentially more complex than for K-means, and so it\\nis common to restrict each cluster prototype to be equal to one of the data vectors as-\\nsigned to that cluster, as this allows the algorithm to be implemented for any choice\\nof dissimilarity measure V(·, ·) so long as it can be readily evaluated. Thus the M\\nstep involves, for each cluster k, a discrete search over the Nk points assigned to that\\ncluster, which requires O(N 2\\nk) evaluations of V(·, ·).\\nOne notable feature of the K-means algorithm is that at each iteration, every\\ndata point is assigned uniquely to one, and only one, of the clusters. Whereas some\\ndata points will be much closer to a particular centre µk than to any other centre,\\nthere may be other data points that lie roughly midway between cluster centres. In\\nthe latter case, it is not clear that the hard assignment to the nearest cluster is the\\nmost appropriate. We shall see in the next section that by adopting a probabilistic\\napproach, we obtain ‘soft’ assignments of data points to clusters in a way that reﬂects\\nthe level of uncertainty over the most appropriate assignment. This probabilistic\\nformulation brings with it numerous beneﬁts.\\n9.1.1\\nImage segmentation and compression\\nAs an illustration of the application of the K-means algorithm, we consider\\nthe related problems of image segmentation and image compression. The goal of\\nsegmentation is to partition an image into regions each of which has a reasonably\\nhomogeneous visual appearance or which corresponds to objects or parts of objects\\n(Forsyth and Ponce, 2003). Each pixel in an image is a point in a 3-dimensional space\\ncomprising the intensities of the red, blue, and green channels, and our segmentation\\nalgorithm simply treats each pixel in the image as a separate data point. Note that\\nstrictly this space is not Euclidean because the channel intensities are bounded by\\nthe interval [0, 1]. Nevertheless, we can apply the K-means algorithm without difﬁ-\\nculty. We illustrate the result of running K-means to convergence, for any particular\\nvalue of K, by re-drawing the image replacing each pixel vector with the {R, G, B}\\nintensity triplet given by the centre µk to which that pixel has been assigned. Results\\nfor various values of K are shown in Figure 9.3. We see that for a given value of K,\\nthe algorithm is representing the image using a palette of only K colours. It should\\nbe emphasized that this use of K-means is not a particularly sophisticated approach\\nto image segmentation, not least because it takes no account of the spatial proximity\\nof different pixels. The image segmentation problem is in general extremely difﬁcult'),\n",

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM\\nThe image segmentation problem discussed above also provides an illustration\\nof the use of clustering for data compression. Suppose the original image has N\\npixels comprising {R, G, B} values each of which is stored with 8 bits of precision.\\nThen to transmit the whole image directly would cost 24N bits. Now suppose we\\nﬁrst run K-means on the image data, and then instead of transmitting the original\\npixel intensity vectors we transmit the identity of the nearest vector µk. Because\\nthere are K such vectors, this requires log2 K bits per pixel. We must also transmit\\nthe K code book vectors µk, which requires 24K bits, and so the total number of\\nbits required to transmit the image is 24K + N log2 K (rounding up to the nearest\\ninteger). The original image shown in Figure 9.3 has 240 × 180 = 43, 200 pixels\\nand so requires 24 × 43, 200 = 1, 036, 800 bits to transmit directly. By comparison,\\nthe compressed images require 43, 248 bits (K = 2), 86, 472 bits (K = 3), and\\n173, 040 bits (K = 10), respectively, to transmit. These represent compression ratios\\ncompared to the original image of 4.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. We see that\\nthere is a trade-off between degree of compression and image quality. Note that our\\naim in this example is to illustrate the K-means algorithm. If we had been aiming to\\nproduce a good image compressor, then it would be more fruitful to consider small\\nblocks of adjacent pixels, for instance 5×5, and thereby exploit the correlations that\\nexist in natural images between nearby pixels.\\n9.2. Mixtures of Gaussians\\nIn Section 2.3.9 we motivated the Gaussian mixture model as a simple linear super-\\nposition of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density mod-\\nels than the single Gaussian. We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in\\nterms of discrete latent variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this\\nimportant distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization\\nalgorithm.\\nRecall from (2.188) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a\\nlinear superposition of Gaussians in the form\\np(x) =\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nπkN(x|µk, Σk).\\n(9.7)\\nLet us introduce a K-dimensional binary random variable z having a 1-of-K repre-\\nsentation in which a particular element zk is equal to 1 and all other elements are\\nequal to 0. The values of zk therefore satisfy zk ∈{0, 1} and \\x05\\nk zk = 1, and we\\nsee that there are K possible states for the vector z according to which element is\\nnonzero. We shall deﬁne the joint distribution p(x, z) in terms of a marginal dis-\\ntribution p(z) and a conditional distribution p(x|z), corresponding to the graphical\\nmodel in Figure 9.4.

As we shall see later,\\nγ(zk) can also be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes for ‘explain-\\ning’ the observation x.\\nWe can use the technique of ancestral sampling to generate random samples\\nSection 8.1.2\\ndistributed according to the Gaussian mixture model. To do this, we ﬁrst generate a\\nvalue for z, which we denote \\x01z, from the marginal distribution p(z) and then generate\\na value for x from the conditional distribution p(x|\\x01z). Techniques for sampling from\\nstandard distributions are discussed in Chapter 11. We can depict samples from the\\njoint distribution p(x, z) by plotting points at the corresponding values of x and\\nthen colouring them according to the value of z, in other words according to which\\nGaussian component was responsible for generating them, as shown in Figure 9.5(a).\\nSimilarly samples from the marginal distribution p(x) are obtained by taking the\\nsamples from the joint distribution and ignoring the values of z. These are illustrated\\nin Figure 9.5(b) by plotting the x values without any coloured labels.\\nWe can also use this synthetic data set to illustrate the ‘responsibilities’ by eval-\\nuating, for every data point, the posterior probability for each component in the\\nmixture distribution from which this data set was generated.

Recall that this problem did not arise in the\\ncase of a single Gaussian distribution. To understand the difference, note that if a\\nsingle Gaussian collapses onto a data point it will contribute multiplicative factors\\nto the likelihood function arising from the other data points and these factors will go\\nto zero exponentially fast, giving an overall likelihood that goes to zero rather than\\ninﬁnity. However, once we have (at least) two components in the mixture, one of\\nthe components can have a ﬁnite variance and therefore assign ﬁnite probability to\\nall of the data points while the other component can shrink onto one speciﬁc data\\npoint and thereby contribute an ever increasing additive value to the log likelihood.\\nThis is illustrated in Figure 9.7.

We see that the mean µk for the kth Gaussian\\ncomponent is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set,\\nin which the weighting factor for data point xn is given by the posterior probability\\nγ(znk) that component k was responsible for generating xn.\\nIf we set the derivative of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to Σk to zero, and follow\\na similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood\\nsolution for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain\\nSection 2.3.4\\nΣk = 1\\nNk\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nγ(znk)(xn −µk)(xn −µk)T\\n(9.19)\\nwhich has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian ﬁtted to\\nthe data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding poste-\\nrior probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points\\nassociated with the corresponding component.\\nFinally, we maximize ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients\\nπk. Here we must take account of the constraint (9.9), which requires the mixing\\ncoefﬁcients to sum to one.

Thus, points that have a signiﬁcant\\nprobability for belonging to either cluster appear purple. The situation after the ﬁrst\\nM step is shown in plot (c), in which the mean of the blue Gaussian has moved to\\nthe mean of the data set, weighted by the probabilities of each data point belonging\\nto the blue cluster, in other words it has moved to the centre of mass of the blue ink.\\nSimilarly, the covariance of the blue Gaussian is set equal to the covariance of the\\nblue ink.

Recall that our goal is to maximize the log\\nlikelihood function (9.14), which is computed using the observed data set X, and we\\nsaw that this was more difﬁcult than for the case of a single Gaussian distribution\\ndue to the presence of the summation over k that occurs inside the logarithm. Sup-\\npose then that in addition to the observed data set X, we were also given the values\\nof the corresponding discrete variables Z. Recall that Figure 9.5(a) shows a ‘com-\\nplete’ data set (i.e., one that includes labels showing which component generated\\neach data point) while Figure 9.5(b) shows the corresponding ‘incomplete’ data set.\\nThe graphical model for the complete data is shown in Figure 9.9.'),\n",

The loga-\\nrithm now acts directly on the Gaussian distribution, which itself is a member of\\nthe exponential family. Not surprisingly, this leads to a much simpler solution to\\nthe maximum likelihood problem, as we now show. Consider ﬁrst the maximization\\nwith respect to the means and covariances. Because zn is a K-dimensional vec-\\ntor with all elements equal to 0 except for a single element having the value 1, the\\ncomplete-data log likelihood function is simply a sum of K independent contribu-\\ntions, one for each mixture component. Thus the maximization with respect to a\\nmean or a covariance is exactly as for a single Gaussian, except that it involves only\\nthe subset of data points that are ‘assigned’ to that component. For the maximization\\nwith respect to the mixing coefﬁcients, we note that these are coupled for different\\nvalues of k by virtue of the summation constraint (9.9). Again, this can be enforced\\nusing a Lagrange multiplier as before, and leads to the result\\nπk = 1\\nN\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nznk\\n(9.37)\\nso that the mixing coefﬁcients are equal to the fractions of data points assigned to\\nthe corresponding components.\\nThus we see that the complete-data log likelihood function can be maximized\\ntrivially in closed form.

MIXTURE MODELS AND EM\\ncomplete EM cycle will change the model parameters in such a way as to cause\\nthe log likelihood to increase (unless it is already at a maximum, in which case the\\nparameters remain unchanged).\\nWe can also use the EM algorithm to maximize the posterior distribution p(θ|X)\\nfor models in which we have introduced a prior p(θ) over the parameters. To see this,\\nwe note that as a function of θ, we have p(θ|X) = p(θ, X)/p(X) and so\\nln p(θ|X) = ln p(θ, X) −ln p(X).\\n(9.76)\\nMaking use of the decomposition (9.70), we have\\nln p(θ|X)\\n=\\nL(q, θ) + KL(q∥p) + ln p(θ) −ln p(X)\\n⩾\\nL(q, θ) + ln p(θ) −ln p(X).\\n(9.77)\\nwhere ln p(X) is a constant. We can again optimize the right-hand side alternately\\nwith respect to q and θ. The optimization with respect to q gives rise to the same E-\\nstep equations as for the standard EM algorithm, because q only appears in L(q, θ).\\nThe M-step equations are modiﬁed through the introduction of the prior term ln p(θ),\\nwhich typically requires only a small modiﬁcation to the standard maximum likeli-\\nhood M-step equations.\\nThe EM algorithm breaks down the potentially difﬁcult problem of maximizing\\nthe likelihood function into two stages, the E step and the M step, each of which will\\noften prove simpler to implement. Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the\\ncase that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable. This\\nleads to two possible extensions of the EM algorithm, as follows.\\nThe generalized EM, or GEM, algorithm addresses the problem of an intractable\\nM step. Instead of aiming to maximize L(q, θ) with respect to θ, it seeks instead\\nto change the parameters in such a way as to increase its value. Again, because\\nL(q, θ) is a lower bound on the log likelihood function, each complete EM cycle of\\nthe GEM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the value of the log likelihood (unless\\nthe parameters already correspond to a local maximum). One way to exploit the\\nGEM approach would be to use one of the nonlinear optimization strategies, such\\nas the conjugate gradients algorithm, during the M step. Another form of GEM\\nalgorithm, known as the expectation conditional maximization, or ECM, algorithm,\\ninvolves making several constrained optimizations within each M step (Meng and\\nRubin, 1993). For instance, the parameters might be partitioned into groups, and the\\nM step is broken down into multiple steps each of which involves optimizing one of\\nthe subset with the remainder held ﬁxed.\\nWe can similarly generalize the E step of the EM algorithm by performing a\\npartial, rather than complete, optimization of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) (Neal and\\nHinton, 1999). As we have seen, for any given value of θ there is a unique maximum\\nof L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) that corresponds to the posterior distribution qθ(Z) =\\np(Z|X, θ) and that for this choice of q(Z) the bound L(q, θ) is equal to the log\\nlikelihood function ln p(X|θ). It follows that any algorithm that converges to the\\nglobal maximum of L(q, θ) will ﬁnd a value of θ that is also a global maximum\\nof the log likelihood ln p(X|θ). Provided p(X, Z|θ) is a continuous function of θ'),\n",

APPROXIMATE INFERENCE\\nanalytical solutions, while the dimensionality of the space and the complexity of the\\nintegrand may prohibit numerical integration. For discrete variables, the marginal-\\nizations involve summing over all possible conﬁgurations of the hidden variables,\\nand though this is always possible in principle, we often ﬁnd in practice that there\\nmay be exponentially many hidden states so that exact calculation is prohibitively\\nexpensive.\\nIn such situations, we need to resort to approximation schemes, and these fall\\nbroadly into two classes, according to whether they rely on stochastic or determin-\\nistic approximations. Stochastic techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, de-\\nscribed in Chapter 11, have enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods across\\nmany domains. They generally have the property that given inﬁnite computational\\nresource, they can generate exact results, and the approximation arises from the use\\nof a ﬁnite amount of processor time. In practice, sampling methods can be compu-\\ntationally demanding, often limiting their use to small-scale problems. Also, it can\\nbe difﬁcult to know whether a sampling scheme is generating independent samples\\nfrom the required distribution.\\nIn this chapter, we introduce a range of deterministic approximation schemes,\\nsome of which scale well to large applications. These are based on analytical ap-\\nproximations to the posterior distribution, for example by assuming that it factorizes\\nin a particular way or that it has a speciﬁc parametric form such as a Gaussian. As\\nsuch, they can never generate exact results, and so their strengths and weaknesses\\nare complementary to those of sampling methods.\\nIn Section 4.4, we discussed the Laplace approximation, which is based on a\\nlocal Gaussian approximation to a mode (i.e., a maximum) of the distribution. Here\\nwe turn to a family of approximation techniques called variational inference or vari-\\national Bayes, which use more global criteria and which have been widely applied.\\nWe conclude with a brief introduction to an alternative variational framework known\\nas expectation propagation.\\n10.1. Variational Inference\\nVariational methods have their origins in the 18th century with the work of Euler,\\nLagrange, and others on the calculus of variations. Standard calculus is concerned\\nwith ﬁnding derivatives of functions. We can think of a function as a mapping that\\ntakes the value of a variable as the input and returns the value of the function as the\\noutput. The derivative of the function then describes how the output value varies\\nas we make inﬁnitesimal changes to the input value. Similarly, we can deﬁne a\\nfunctional as a mapping that takes a function as the input and that returns the value\\nof the functional as the output. An example would be the entropy H[p], which takes\\na probability distribution p(x) as the input and returns the quantity\\nH[p] =\\n\\x06\\np(x) ln p(x) dx\\n(10.1)'),\n",

We can the introduce the concept of a functional derivative, which ex-\\npresses how the value of the functional changes in response to inﬁnitesimal changes\\nto the input function (Feynman et al., 1964). The rules for the calculus of variations\\nmirror those of standard calculus and are discussed in Appendix D. Many problems\\ncan be expressed in terms of an optimization problem in which the quantity being\\noptimized is a functional. The solution is obtained by exploring all possible input\\nfunctions to ﬁnd the one that maximizes, or minimizes, the functional. Variational\\nmethods have broad applicability and include such areas as ﬁnite element methods\\n(Kapur, 1989) and maximum entropy (Schwarz, 1988).\\nAlthough there is nothing intrinsically approximate about variational methods,\\nthey do naturally lend themselves to ﬁnding approximate solutions. This is done\\nby restricting the range of functions over which the optimization is performed, for\\ninstance by considering only quadratic functions or by considering functions com-\\nposed of a linear combination of ﬁxed basis functions in which only the coefﬁcients\\nof the linear combination can vary. In the case of applications to probabilistic in-\\nference, the restriction may for example take the form of factorization assumptions\\n(Jordan et al., 1999; Jaakkola, 2001).\\nNow let us consider in more detail how the concept of variational optimization\\ncan be applied to the inference problem. Suppose we have a fully Bayesian model in\\nwhich all parameters are given prior distributions. The model may also have latent\\nvariables as well as parameters, and we shall denote the set of all latent variables\\nand parameters by Z. Similarly, we denote the set of all observed variables by X.\\nFor example, we might have a set of N independent, identically distributed data,\\nfor which X = {x1, . . . , xN} and Z = {z1, . . . , zN}. Our probabilistic model\\nspeciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Z), and our goal is to ﬁnd an approximation for\\nthe posterior distribution p(Z|X) as well as for the model evidence p(X). As in our\\ndiscussion of EM, we can decompose the log marginal probability using\\nln p(X) = L(q) + KL(q∥p)\\n(10.2)\\nwhere we have deﬁned\\nL(q)\\n=\\n\\x06\\nq(Z) ln\\n\\x0cp(X, Z)\\nq(Z)\\n\\r\\ndZ\\n(10.3)\\nKL(q∥p)\\n=\\n−\\n\\x06\\nq(Z) ln\\n\\x0cp(Z|X)\\nq(Z)\\n\\r\\ndZ.\\n(10.4)\\nThis differs from our discussion of EM only in that the parameter vector θ no longer\\nappears, because the parameters are now stochastic variables and are absorbed into\\nZ. Since in this chapter we will mainly be interested in continuous variables we have\\nused integrations rather than summations in formulating this decomposition. How-\\never, the analysis goes through unchanged if some or all of the variables are discrete\\nsimply by replacing the integrations with summations as required. As before, we\\ncan maximize the lower bound L(q) by optimization with respect to the distribution\\nq(Z), which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence. If we allow any possible\\nchoice for q(Z), then the maximum of the lower bound occurs when the KL diver-\\ngence vanishes, which occurs when q(Z) equals the posterior distribution p(Z|X).'),\n",

In particular, we place no restriction on the functional forms of the individual\\nfactors qi(Zi). This factorized form of variational inference corresponds to an ap-\\nproximation framework developed in physics called mean ﬁeld theory (Parisi, 1988).\\nAmongst all distributions q(Z) having the form (10.5), we now seek that distri-\\nbution for which the lower bound L(q) is largest. We therefore wish to make a free\\nform (variational) optimization of L(q) with respect to all of the distributions qi(Zi),\\nwhich we do by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. To achieve\\nthis, we ﬁrst substitute (10.5) into (10.3) and then dissect out the dependence on one\\nof the factors qj(Zj). Denoting qj(Zj) by simply qj to keep the notation uncluttered,\\nwe then obtain\\nL(q)\\n=\\n\\x06 \\x0e\\ni\\nqi\\n\\x18\\nln p(X, Z) −\\n\\x02\\ni\\nln qi\\n\\x19\\ndZ\\n=\\n\\x06\\nqj\\n\\x18\\x06\\nln p(X, Z)\\n\\x0e\\ni̸=j\\nqi dZi\\n\\x19\\ndZj −\\n\\x06\\nqj ln qj dZj + const\\n=\\n\\x06\\nqj ln\\x04p(X, Zj) dZj −\\n\\x06\\nqj ln qj dZj + const\\n(10.6)\\nwhere we have deﬁned a new distribution \\x04p(X, Zj) by the relation\\nln\\x04p(X, Zj) = Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const.\\n(10.7)\\nHere the notation Ei̸=j[· · · ] denotes an expectation with respect to the q distributions\\nover all variables zi for i ̸= j, so that\\nEi̸=j[ln p(X, Z)] =\\n\\x06\\nln p(X, Z)\\n\\x0e\\ni̸=j\\nqi dZi.\\n(10.8)\\nNow suppose we keep the {qi̸=j} ﬁxed and maximize L(q) in (10.6) with re-\\nspect to all possible forms for the distribution qj(Zj).

It says that the log of the optimal so-\\nlution for factor qj is obtained simply by considering the log of the joint distribution\\nover all hidden and visible variables and then taking the expectation with respect to\\nall of the other factors {qi} for i ̸= j.\\nThe additive constant in (10.9) is set by normalizing the distribution q⋆\\nj (Zj).\\nThus if we take the exponential of both sides and normalize, we have\\nq⋆\\nj (Zj) =\\nexp (Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)])\\n\\x06\\nexp (Ei̸=j[ln p(X, Z)]) dZj\\n.\\nIn practice, we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to work with the form (10.9) and then re-\\ninstate the normalization constant (where required) by inspection. This will become\\nclear from subsequent examples.\\nThe set of equations given by (10.9) for j = 1, . . . , M represent a set of con-\\nsistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization\\nconstraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expres-\\nsion on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum q⋆\\nj (Zj) depends on expectations\\ncomputed with respect to the other factors qi(Zi) for i ̸= j. We will therefore seek\\na consistent solution by ﬁrst initializing all of the factors qi(Zi) appropriately and\\nthen cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate\\ngiven by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of\\nthe other factors. Convergence is guaranteed because bound is convex with respect\\nto each of the factors qi(Zi) (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).\\n10.1.2\\nProperties of factorized approximations\\nOur approach to variational inference is based on a factorized approximation to\\nthe true posterior distribution. Let us consider for a moment the problem of approx-\\nimating a general distribution by a factorized distribution.

It is worth emphasizing\\nthat we did not assume that q(zi) is Gaussian, but rather we derived this result by\\nvariational optimization of the KL divergence over all possible distributions q(zi).\\nNote also that we do not need to consider the additive constant in (10.9) explicitly\\nbecause it represents the normalization constant that can be found at the end by\\ninspection if required.

Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians\\nWe now return to our discussion of the Gaussian mixture model and apply the vari-\\national inference machinery developed in the previous section. This will provide a\\ngood illustration of the application of variational methods and will also demonstrate\\nhow a Bayesian treatment elegantly resolves many of the difﬁculties associated with\\nthe maximum likelihood approach (Attias, 1999b). The reader is encouraged to work\\nthrough this example in detail as it provides many insights into the practical appli-\\ncation of variational methods. Many Bayesian models, corresponding to much more\\nsophisticated distributions, can be solved by straightforward extensions and general-\\nizations of this analysis.\\nOur starting point is the likelihood function for the Gaussian mixture model, il-\\nlustrated by the graphical model in Figure 9.6. For each observation xn we have\\na corresponding latent variable zn comprising a 1-of-K binary vector with ele-\\nments znk for k = 1, . . . , K. As before we denote the observed data set by X =\\n{x1, . . . , xN}, and similarly we denote the latent variables by Z = {z1, . . . , zN}.\\nFrom (9.10) we can write down the conditional distribution of Z, given the mixing\\ncoefﬁcients π, in the form\\np(Z|π) =\\nN\\n\\x0e\\nn=1\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\nπznk\\nk\\n.\\n(10.37)\\nSimilarly, from (9.11), we can write down the conditional distribution of the ob-\\nserved data vectors, given the latent variables and the component parameters\\np(X|Z, µ, Λ) =\\nN\\n\\x0e\\nn=1\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\nN \\nxn|µk, Λ−1\\nk\\n\\x0bznk\\n(10.38)\\nwhere µ = {µk} and Λ = {Λk}. Note that we are working in terms of precision\\nmatrices rather than covariance matrices as this somewhat simpliﬁes the mathemat-\\nics.\\nNext we introduce priors over the parameters µ, Λ and π. The analysis is con-\\nsiderably simpliﬁed if we use conjugate prior distributions. We therefore choose a\\nSection 10.4.1\\nDirichlet distribution over the mixing coefﬁcients π\\np(π) = Dir(π|α0) = C(α0)\\nK\\n\\x0e\\nk=1\\nπα0−1\\nk\\n(10.39)\\nwhere by symmetry we have chosen the same parameter α0 for each of the compo-\\nnents, and C(α0) is the normalization constant for the Dirichlet distribution deﬁned'),\n",

We can take this a stage further to provide a deeper test of the correctness\\nof both the mathematical derivation of the update equations and of their software im-\\nplementation by using ﬁnite differences to check that each update does indeed give\\na (constrained) maximum of the bound (Svens´en and Bishop, 2004).\\nFor the variational mixture of Gaussians, the lower bound (10.3) is given by\\nL\\n=\\n\\x02\\nZ\\n\\x06\\x06\\x06\\nq(Z, π, µ, Λ) ln\\n\\x0cp(X, Z, π, µ, Λ)\\nq(Z, π, µ, Λ)\\n\\r\\ndπ dµ dΛ\\n=\\nE[ln p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ)] −E[ln q(Z, π, µ, Λ)]\\n=\\nE[ln p(X|Z, µ, Λ)] + E[ln p(Z|π)] + E[ln p(π)] + E[ln p(µ, Λ)]\\n−E[ln q(Z)] −E[ln q(π)] −E[ln q(µ, Λ)]\\n(10.70)\\nwhere, to keep the notation uncluttered, we have omitted the ⋆superscript on the\\nq distributions, along with the subscripts on the expectation operators because each\\nexpectation is taken with respect to all of the random variables in its argument.

Then the parameter values π1 = b, π2 = a, µ1 = d,\\nµ2 = c, σ1 = f, σ2 = e, in which the two components have been exchanged, will\\nby symmetry give rise to the same value of p(x). If we have a mixture model com-\\nprising K components, then each parameter setting will be a member of a family of\\nK! equivalent settings.\\nExercise 10.21\\nIn the context of maximum likelihood, this redundancy is irrelevant because the\\nparameter optimization algorithm (for example EM) will, depending on the initial-\\nization of the parameters, ﬁnd one speciﬁc solution, and the other equivalent solu-\\ntions play no role.

However, the optimal solutions for the various factors exhibit additional\\nfactorizations. In particular, the solution for q⋆(µ, Λ) is given by the product of an\\nindependent distribution q⋆(µk, Λk) over each of the components k of the mixture,\\nwhereas the variational posterior distribution q⋆(Z) over the latent variables, given\\nby (10.48), factorizes into an independent distribution q⋆(zn) for each observation n\\n(note that it does not further factorize with respect to k because, for each value of n,\\nthe znk are constrained to sum to one over k). These additional factorizations are a\\nconsequence of the interaction between the assumed factorization and the conditional\\nindependence properties of the true distribution, as characterized by the directed\\ngraph in Figure 10.5.\\nWe shall refer to these additional factorizations as induced factorizations be-\\ncause they arise from an interaction between the factorization assumed in the varia-\\ntional posterior distribution and the conditional independence properties of the true\\njoint distribution. In a numerical implementation of the variational approach it is\\nimportant to take account of such additional factorizations. For instance, it would\\nbe very inefﬁcient to maintain a full precision matrix for the Gaussian distribution\\nover a set of variables if the optimal form for that distribution always had a diago-\\nnal precision matrix (corresponding to a factorization with respect to the individual\\nvariables described by that Gaussian).\\nSuch induced factorizations can easily be detected using a simple graphical test\\nbased on d-separation as follows. We partition the latent variables into three disjoint\\ngroups A, B, C and then let us suppose that we are assuming a factorization between\\nC and the remaining latent variables, so that\\nq(A, B, C) = q(A, B)q(C).\\n(10.84)\\nUsing the general result (10.9), together with the product rule for probabilities, we\\nsee that the optimal solution for q(A, B) is given by\\nln q⋆(A, B)\\n=\\nEC[ln p(X, A, B, C)] + const\\n=\\nEC[ln p(A, B|X, C)] + const.\\n(10.85)\\nWe now ask whether this resulting solution will factorize between A and B, in\\nother words whether q⋆(A, B) = q⋆(A)q⋆(B).

We can see immediately that the variational posterior\\ndistribution over the parameters must factorize between π and the remaining param-\\neters µ and Λ because all paths connecting π to either µ or Λ must pass through\\none of the nodes zn all of which are in the conditioning set for our conditional inde-\\npendence test and all of which are head-to-tail with respect to such paths.\\n10.3. Variational Linear Regression\\nAs a second illustration of variational inference, we return to the Bayesian linear\\nregression model of Section 3.3. In the evidence framework, we approximated the\\nintegration over α and β by making point estimates obtained by maximizing the log\\nmarginal likelihood. A fully Bayesian approach would integrate over the hyperpa-\\nrameters as well as over the parameters. Although exact integration is intractable,\\nwe can use variational methods to ﬁnd a tractable approximation. In order to sim-\\nplify the discussion, we shall suppose that the noise precision parameter β is known,\\nand is ﬁxed to its true value, although the framework is easily extended to include\\nthe distribution over β. For the linear regression model, the variational treatment\\nExercise 10.26\\nwill turn out to be equivalent to the evidence framework. Nevertheless, it provides a\\ngood exercise in the use of variational methods and will also lay the foundation for\\nvariational treatment of Bayesian logistic regression in Section 10.6.\\nRecall that the likelihood function for w, and the prior over w, are given by\\np(t|w)\\n=\\nN\\n\\x0e\\nn=1\\nN(tn|wTφn, β−1)\\n(10.87)\\np(w|α)\\n=\\nN(w|0, α−1I)\\n(10.88)\\nwhere φn = φ(xn). We now introduce a prior distribution over α.

However,\\nin general this will not be the case for the marginal likelihood function for the ob-\\nserved data. For example, in a mixture of Gaussians, the joint distribution of obser-\\nvations xn and corresponding hidden variables zn is a member of the exponential\\nfamily, whereas the marginal distribution of xn is a mixture of Gaussians and hence\\nis not.\\nUp to now we have grouped the variables in the model into observed variables\\nand hidden variables. We now make a further distinction between latent variables,\\ndenoted Z, and parameters, denoted θ, where parameters are intensive (ﬁxed in num-\\nber independent of the size of the data set), whereas latent variables are extensive\\n(scale in number with the size of the data set). For example, in a Gaussian mixture\\nmodel, the indicator variables zkn (which specify which component k is responsible\\nfor generating data point xn) represent the latent variables, whereas the means µk,\\nprecisions Λk and mixing proportions πk represent the parameters.\\nConsider the case of independent identically distributed data. We denote the\\ndata values by X = {xn}, where n = 1, . . . N, with corresponding latent variables\\nZ = {zn}.

Note that xi may be a latent variable or it may belong\\nto the set of observed variables.

In fact, the only terms that do depend on xj are the con-\\nditional distribution for xj given by p(xj|paj) together with any other conditional\\ndistributions that have xj in the conditioning set. By deﬁnition, these conditional\\ndistributions correspond to the children of node j, and they therefore also depend on\\nthe co-parents of the child nodes, i.e., the other parents of the child nodes besides\\nnode xj itself. We see that the set of all nodes on which q⋆(xj) depends corresponds\\nto the Markov blanket of node xj, as illustrated in Figure 8.26. Thus the update\\nof the factors in the variational posterior distribution represents a local calculation\\non the graph. This makes possible the construction of general purpose software for\\nvariational inference in which the form of the model does not need to be speciﬁed in\\nadvance (Bishop et al., 2003).\\nIf we now specialize to the case of a model in which all of the conditional dis-\\ntributions have a conjugate-exponential structure, then the variational update proce-\\ndure can be cast in terms of a local message passing algorithm (Winn and Bishop,\\n2005). In particular, the distribution associated with a particular node can be updated\\nonce that node has received messages from all of its parents and all of its children.\\nThis in turn requires that the children have already received messages from their co-\\nparents. The evaluation of the lower bound can also be simpliﬁed because many of\\nthe required quantities are already evaluated as part of the message passing scheme.\\nThis distributed message passing formulation has good scaling properties and is well\\nsuited to large networks.'),\n",

Local Variational Methods\\n493\\n10.5. Local Variational Methods\\nThe variational framework discussed in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 can be considered a\\n‘global’ method in the sense that it directly seeks an approximation to the full poste-\\nrior distribution over all random variables. An alternative ‘local’ approach involves\\nﬁnding bounds on functions over individual variables or groups of variables within\\na model. For instance, we might seek a bound on a conditional distribution p(y|x),\\nwhich is itself just one factor in a much larger probabilistic model speciﬁed by a\\ndirected graph. The purpose of introducing the bound of course is to simplify the\\nresulting distribution. This local approximation can be applied to multiple variables\\nin turn until a tractable approximation is obtained, and in Section 10.6.1 we shall\\ngive a practical example of this approach in the context of logistic regression. Here\\nwe focus on developing the bounds themselves.\\nWe have already seen in our discussion of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that\\nthe convexity of the logarithm function played a key role in developing the lower\\nbound in the global variational approach. We have deﬁned a (strictly) convex func-\\ntion as one for which every chord lies above the function. Convexity also plays a\\nSection 1.6.1\\ncentral role in the local variational framework. Note that our discussion will ap-\\nply equally to concave functions with ‘min’ and ‘max’ interchanged and with lower\\nbounds replaced by upper bounds.\\nLet us begin by considering a simple example, namely the function f(x) =\\nexp(−x), which is a convex function of x, and which is shown in the left-hand plot\\nof Figure 10.10. Our goal is to approximate f(x) by a simpler function, in particular\\na linear function of x. From Figure 10.10, we see that this linear function will be a\\nlower bound on f(x) if it corresponds to a tangent. We can obtain the tangent line\\ny(x) at a speciﬁc value of x, say x = ξ, by making a ﬁrst order Taylor expansion\\ny(x) = f(ξ) + f ′(ξ)(x −ξ)\\n(10.125)\\nso that y(x) ⩽f(x) with equality when x = ξ.

We see that the bound has the form of the exponential of a quadratic\\nfunction of x, which will prove useful when we seek Gaussian representations of\\nposterior distributions deﬁned through logistic sigmoid functions.\\nSection 4.5\\nThe logistic sigmoid arises frequently in probabilistic models over binary vari-\\nables because it is the function that transforms a log odds ratio into a posterior prob-\\nability.

Variational Logistic Regression\\nWe now illustrate the use of local variational methods by returning to the Bayesian\\nlogistic regression model studied in Section 4.5. There we focussed on the use of\\nthe Laplace approximation, while here we consider a variational treatment based on\\nthe approach of Jaakkola and Jordan (2000). Like the Laplace method, this also\\nleads to a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. However, the greater\\nﬂexibility of the variational approximation leads to improved accuracy compared\\nto the Laplace method. Furthermore (unlike the Laplace method), the variational\\napproach is optimizing a well deﬁned objective function given by a rigourous bound\\non the model evidence. Logistic regression has also been treated by Dybowski and\\nRoberts (2005) from a Bayesian perspective using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.\\n10.6.1\\nVariational posterior distribution\\nHere we shall make use of a variational approximation based on the local bounds\\nintroduced in Section 10.5. This allows the likelihood function for logistic regres-\\nsion, which is governed by the logistic sigmoid, to be approximated by the expo-\\nnential of a quadratic form. It is therefore again convenient to choose a conjugate\\nGaussian prior of the form (4.140). For the moment, we shall treat the hyperparam-\\neters m0 and S0 as ﬁxed constants. In Section 10.6.3, we shall demonstrate how the\\nvariational formalism can be extended to the case where there are unknown hyper-\\nparameters whose values are to be inferred from the data.\\nIn the variational framework, we seek to maximize a lower bound on the marginal\\nlikelihood.

APPROXIMATE INFERENCE\\nWe see that the optimum solution simply corresponds to matching the expected suf-\\nﬁcient statistics. So, for instance, if q(z) is a Gaussian N(z|µ, Σ) then we minimize\\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence by setting the mean µ of q(z) equal to the mean of\\nthe distribution p(z) and the covariance Σ equal to the covariance of p(z). This is\\nsometimes called moment matching. An example of this was seen in Figure 10.3(a).\\nNow let us exploit this result to obtain a practical algorithm for approximate\\ninference. For many probabilistic models, the joint distribution of data D and hidden\\nvariables (including parameters) θ comprises a product of factors in the form\\np(D, θ) =\\n\\x0e\\ni\\nfi(θ).\\n(10.188)\\nThis would arise, for example, in a model for independent, identically distributed\\ndata in which there is one factor fn(θ) = p(xn|θ) for each data point xn, along\\nwith a factor f0(θ) = p(θ) corresponding to the prior. More generally, it would also\\napply to any model deﬁned by a directed probabilistic graph in which each factor is a\\nconditional distribution corresponding to one of the nodes, or an undirected graph in\\nwhich each factor is a clique potential. We are interested in evaluating the posterior\\ndistribution p(θ|D) for the purpose of making predictions, as well as the model\\nevidence p(D) for the purpose of model comparison. From (10.188) the posterior is\\ngiven by\\np(θ|D) =\\n1\\np(D)\\n\\x0e\\ni\\nfi(θ)\\n(10.189)\\nand the model evidence is given by\\np(D) =\\n\\x06 \\x0e\\ni\\nfi(θ) dθ.\\n(10.190)\\nHere we are considering continuous variables, but the following discussion applies\\nequally to discrete variables with integrals replaced by summations. We shall sup-\\npose that the marginalization over θ, along with the marginalizations with respect to\\nthe posterior distribution required to make predictions, are intractable so that some\\nform of approximation is required.\\nExpectation propagation is based on an approximation to the posterior distribu-\\ntion which is also given by a product of factors\\nq(θ) = 1\\nZ\\n\\x0e\\ni\\n\\x04fi(θ)\\n(10.191)\\nin which each factor \\x04fi(θ) in the approximation corresponds to one of the factors\\nfi(θ) in the true posterior (10.189), and the factor 1/Z is the normalizing constant\\nneeded to ensure that the left-hand side of (10.191) integrates to unity. In order to\\nobtain a practical algorithm, we need to constrain the factors \\x04fi(θ) in some way,\\nand in particular we shall assume that they come from the exponential family. The\\nproduct of the factors will therefore also be from the exponential family and so can'),\n",

In general, this minimization will be intractable because the KL di-\\nvergence involves averaging with respect to the true distribution. As a rough approx-\\nimation, we could instead minimize the KL divergences between the corresponding\\npairs fi(θ) and \\x04fi(θ) of factors. This represents a much simpler problem to solve,\\nand has the advantage that the algorithm is noniterative. However, because each fac-\\ntor is individually approximated, the product of the factors could well give a poor\\napproximation.\\nExpectation propagation makes a much better approximation by optimizing each\\nfactor in turn in the context of all of the remaining factors. It starts by initializing\\nthe factors \\x04fi(θ), and then cycles through the factors reﬁning them one at a time.\\nThis is similar in spirit to the update of factors in the variational Bayes framework\\nconsidered earlier. Suppose we wish to reﬁne factor \\x04fj(θ). We ﬁrst remove this\\nfactor from the product to give \\x15\\ni̸=j \\x04fi(θ).

Assumed density ﬁltering can be appropriate for on-line learning in which data\\npoints are arriving in a sequence and we need to learn from each data point and then\\ndiscard it before considering the next point. However, in a batch setting we have the\\nopportunity to re-use the data points many times in order to achieve improved ac-\\ncuracy, and it is this idea that is exploited in expectation propagation. Furthermore,\\nif we apply ADF to batch data, the results will have an undesirable dependence on\\nthe (arbitrary) order in which the data points are considered, which again EP can\\novercome.\\nOne disadvantage of expectation propagation is that there is no guarantee that\\nthe iterations will converge. However, for approximations q(θ) in the exponential\\nfamily, if the iterations do converge, the resulting solution will be a stationary point\\nof a particular energy function (Minka, 2001a), although each iteration of EP does\\nnot necessarily decrease the value of this energy function. This is in contrast to\\nvariational Bayes, which iteratively maximizes a lower bound on the log marginal\\nlikelihood, in which each iteration is guaranteed not to decrease the bound. It is\\npossible to optimize the EP cost function directly, in which case it is guaranteed\\nto converge, although the resulting algorithms can be slower and more complex to\\nimplement.\\nAnother difference between variational Bayes and EP arises from the form of\\nKL divergence that is minimized by the two algorithms, because the former mini-\\nmizes KL(q∥p) whereas the latter minimizes KL(p∥q). As we saw in Figure 10.3,\\nfor distributions p(θ) which are multimodal, minimizing KL(p∥q) can lead to poor\\napproximations. In particular, if EP is applied to mixtures the results are not sen-\\nsible because the approximation tries to capture all of the modes of the posterior\\ndistribution. Conversely, in logistic-type models, EP often out-performs both local\\nvariational methods and the Laplace approximation (Kuss and Rasmussen, 2006).'),\n",

APPROXIMATE INFERENCE\\nThese are precisely the messages obtained using belief propagation in which mes-\\nSection 8.4.4\\nsages from variable nodes to factor nodes have been folded into the messages from\\nfactor nodes to variable nodes. In particular, \\x04fb2(x2) corresponds to the message\\nµfb→x2(x2) sent by factor node fb to variable node x2 and is given by (8.81). Simi-\\nlarly, if we substitute (8.78) into (8.79), we obtain (10.235) in which \\x04fa2(x2) corre-\\nsponds to µfa→x2(x2) and \\x04fc2(x2) corresponds to µfc→x2(x2), giving the message\\n\\x04fb3(x3) which corresponds to µfb→x3(x3).\\nThis result differs slightly from standard belief propagation in that messages are\\npassed in both directions at the same time. We can easily modify the EP procedure\\nto give the standard form of the sum-product algorithm by updating just one of the\\nfactors at a time, for instance if we reﬁne only \\x04fb3(x3), then \\x04fb2(x2) is unchanged\\nby deﬁnition, while the reﬁned version of \\x04fb3(x3) is again given by (10.235). If\\nwe are reﬁning only one term at a time, then we can choose the order in which the\\nreﬁnements are done as we wish. In particular, for a tree-structured graph we can\\nfollow a two-pass update scheme, corresponding to the standard belief propagation\\nschedule, which will result in exact inference of the variable and factor marginals.\\nThe initialization of the approximation factors in this case is unimportant.\\nNow let us consider a general factor graph corresponding to the distribution\\np(θ) =\\n\\x0e\\ni\\nfi(θi)\\n(10.236)\\nwhere θi represents the subset of variables associated with factor fi.

SAMPLING METHODS\\n525\\nstraightforward to sample from the joint distribution (assuming that it is possible to\\nsample from the conditional distributions at each node) using the following ances-\\ntral sampling approach, discussed brieﬂy in Section 8.1.2. The joint distribution is\\nspeciﬁed by\\np(z) =\\nM\\n\\x0e\\ni=1\\np(zi|pai)\\n(11.4)\\nwhere zi are the set of variables associated with node i, and pai denotes the set of\\nvariables associated with the parents of node i. To obtain a sample from the joint\\ndistribution, we make one pass through the set of variables in the order z1, . . . , zM\\nsampling from the conditional distributions p(zi|pai). This is always possible be-\\ncause at each step all of the parent values will have been instantiated. After one pass\\nthrough the graph, we will have obtained a sample from the joint distribution.\\nNow consider the case of a directed graph in which some of the nodes are in-\\nstantiated with observed values. We can in principle extend the above procedure, at\\nleast in the case of nodes representing discrete variables, to give the following logic\\nsampling approach (Henrion, 1988), which can be seen as a special case of impor-\\ntance sampling discussed in Section 11.1.4. At each step, when a sampled value is\\nobtained for a variable zi whose value is observed, the sampled value is compared\\nto the observed value, and if they agree then the sample value is retained and the al-\\ngorithm proceeds to the next variable in turn. However, if the sampled value and the\\nobserved value disagree, then the whole sample so far is discarded and the algorithm\\nstarts again with the ﬁrst node in the graph. This algorithm samples correctly from\\nthe posterior distribution because it corresponds simply to drawing samples from the\\njoint distribution of hidden variables and data variables and then discarding those\\nsamples that disagree with the observed data (with the slight saving of not continu-\\ning with the sampling from the joint distribution as soon as one contradictory value is\\nobserved). However, the overall probability of accepting a sample from the posterior\\ndecreases rapidly as the number of observed variables increases and as the number\\nof states that those variables can take increases, and so this approach is rarely used\\nin practice.\\nIn the case of probability distributions deﬁned by an undirected graph, there is\\nno one-pass sampling strategy that will sample even from the prior distribution with\\nno observed variables. Instead, computationally more expensive techniques must be\\nemployed, such as Gibbs sampling, which is discussed in Section 11.3.\\nAs well as sampling from conditional distributions, we may also require samples\\nfrom a marginal distribution. If we already have a strategy for sampling from a joint\\ndistribution p(u, v), then it is straightforward to obtain samples from the marginal\\ndistribution p(u) simply by ignoring the values for v in each sample.\\nThere are numerous texts dealing with Monte Carlo methods. Those of partic-\\nular interest from the statistical inference perspective include Chen et al. (2001),\\nGamerman (1997), Gilks et al.

Thus, y = h−1(z), and so we have to\\nExercise 11.2\\ntransform the uniformly distributed random numbers using a function which is the\\ninverse of the indeﬁnite integral of the desired distribution. This is illustrated in\\nFigure 11.2.\\nConsider for example the exponential distribution\\np(y) = λ exp(−λy)\\n(11.7)\\nwhere 0 ⩽y < ∞. In this case the lower limit of the integral in (11.6) is 0, and so\\nh(y) = 1 −exp(−λy).

If the\\nsample is accepted, then it will be a draw from the desired distribution. If, however,\\nthe sample is rejected, then it is incorporated into the set of grid points, a new tangent\\nline is computed, and the envelope function is thereby reﬁned. As the number of\\ngrid points increases, so the envelope function becomes a better approximation of\\nthe desired distribution p(z) and the probability of rejection decreases.\\nA variant of the algorithm exists that avoids the evaluation of derivatives (Gilks,\\n1992). The adaptive rejection sampling framework can also be extended to distri-\\nbutions that are not log concave, simply by following each rejection sampling step\\nwith a Metropolis-Hastings step (to be discussed in Section 11.2.2), giving rise to\\nadaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (Gilks et al., 1995).\\nClearly for rejection sampling to be of practical value, we require that the com-\\nparison function be close to the required distribution so that the rate of rejection is\\nkept to a minimum. Now let us examine what happens when we try to use rejection\\nsampling in spaces of high dimensionality. Consider, for the sake of illustration,\\na somewhat artiﬁcial problem in which we wish to sample from a zero-mean mul-\\ntivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance σ2\\npI, where I is the unit matrix, by\\nrejection sampling from a proposal distribution that is itself a zero-mean Gaussian\\ndistribution having covariance σ2\\nqI. Obviously, we must have σ2\\nq ⩾σ2\\np in order that\\nthere exists a k such that kq(z) ⩾p(z). In D-dimensions the optimum value of k\\nis given by k = (σq/σp)D, as illustrated for D = 1 in Figure 11.7. The acceptance\\nrate will be the ratio of volumes under p(z) and kq(z), which, because both distribu-\\ntions are normalized, is just 1/k. Thus the acceptance rate diminishes exponentially\\nwith dimensionality. Even if σq exceeds σp by just one percent, for D = 1, 000 the\\nacceptance ratio will be approximately 1/20, 000. In this illustrative example the\\ncomparison function is close to the required distribution. For more practical exam-\\nples, where the desired distribution may be multimodal and sharply peaked, it will\\nbe extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd a good proposal distribution and comparison function.'),\n",

The technique\\nof importance sampling provides a framework for approximating expectations di-\\nrectly but does not itself provide a mechanism for drawing samples from distribution\\np(z).\\nThe ﬁnite sum approximation to the expectation, given by (11.2), depends on\\nbeing able to draw samples from the distribution p(z). Suppose, however, that it is\\nimpractical to sample directly from p(z) but that we can evaluate p(z) easily for any\\ngiven value of z. One simplistic strategy for evaluating expectations would be to\\ndiscretize z-space into a uniform grid and to evaluate the integrand as a sum of the\\nform\\nE[f] ≃\\nL\\n\\x02\\nl=1\\np(z(l))f(z(l)).\\n(11.18)\\nAn obvious problem with this approach is that the number of terms in the summation\\ngrows exponentially with the dimensionality of z.

We would really like\\nto choose the sample points to fall in regions where p(z) is large, or ideally where\\nthe product p(z)f(z) is large.\\nAs in the case of rejection sampling, importance sampling is based on the use\\nof a proposal distribution q(z) from which it is easy to draw samples, as illustrated\\nin Figure 11.8.

SAMPLING METHODS\\ndistribution p(z). If, as is often the case, p(z)f(z) is strongly varying and has a sig-\\nniﬁcant proportion of its mass concentrated over relatively small regions of z space,\\nthen the set of importance weights {rl} may be dominated by a few weights hav-\\ning large values, with the remaining weights being relatively insigniﬁcant. Thus the\\neffective sample size can be much smaller than the apparent sample size L. The prob-\\nlem is even more severe if none of the samples falls in the regions where p(z)f(z)\\nis large. In that case, the apparent variances of rl and rlf(z(l)) may be small even\\nthough the estimate of the expectation may be severely wrong. Hence a major draw-\\nback of the importance sampling method is the potential to produce results that are\\narbitrarily in error and with no diagnostic indication. This also highlights a key re-\\nquirement for the sampling distribution q(z), namely that it should not be small or\\nzero in regions where p(z) may be signiﬁcant.\\nFor distributions deﬁned in terms of a graphical model, we can apply the impor-\\ntance sampling technique in various ways. For discrete variables, a simple approach\\nis called uniform sampling. The joint distribution for a directed graph is deﬁned\\nby (11.4). Each sample from the joint distribution is obtained by ﬁrst setting those\\nvariables zi that are in the evidence set equal to their observed values. Each of the\\nremaining variables is then sampled independently from a uniform distribution over\\nthe space of possible instantiations. To determine the corresponding weight associ-\\nated with a sample z(l), we note that the sampling distribution \\x04q(z) is uniform over\\nthe possible choices for z, and that \\x04p(z|x) = \\x04p(z), where x denotes the subset of\\nvariables that are observed, and the equality follows from the fact that every sample\\nz that is generated is necessarily consistent with the evidence. Thus the weights rl\\nare simply proportional to p(z). Note that the variables can be sampled in any order.\\nThis approach can yield poor results if the posterior distribution is far from uniform,\\nas is often the case in practice.\\nAn improvement on this approach is called likelihood weighted sampling (Fung\\nand Chang, 1990; Shachter and Peot, 1990) and is based on ancestral sampling of\\nthe variables. For each variable in turn, if that variable is in the evidence set, then it\\nis just set to its instantiated value. If it is not in the evidence set, then it is sampled\\nfrom the conditional distribution p(zi|pai) in which the conditioning variables are\\nset to their currently sampled values. The weighting associated with the resulting\\nsample z is then given by\\nr(z) =\\n\\x0e\\nzi̸∈e\\np(zi|pai)\\np(zi|pai)\\n\\x0e\\nzi∈e\\np(zi|pai)\\n1\\n=\\n\\x0e\\nzi∈e\\np(zi|pai).\\n(11.24)\\nThis method can be further extended using self-importance sampling (Shachter and\\nPeot, 1990) in which the importance sampling distribution is continually updated to\\nreﬂect the current estimated posterior distribution.\\n11.1.5\\nSampling-importance-resampling\\nThe rejection sampling method discussed in Section 11.1.2 depends in part for\\nits success on the determination of a suitable value for the constant k.

There are two stages to the scheme. In the ﬁrst stage,\\nL samples z(1), . . . , z(L) are drawn from q(z). Then in the second stage, weights\\nw1, . . . , wL are constructed using (11.23). Finally, a second set of L samples is\\ndrawn from the discrete distribution (z(1), . . . , z(L)) with probabilities given by the\\nweights (w1, . . . , wL).\\nThe resulting L samples are only approximately distributed according to p(z),\\nbut the distribution becomes correct in the limit L →∞.

SAMPLING METHODS\\nand which scales well with the dimensionality of the sample space. Markov chain\\nMonte Carlo methods have their origins in physics (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949),\\nand it was only towards the end of the 1980s that they started to have a signiﬁcant\\nimpact in the ﬁeld of statistics.\\nAs with rejection and importance sampling, we again sample from a proposal\\ndistribution. This time, however, we maintain a record of the current state z(τ), and\\nthe proposal distribution q(z|z(τ)) depends on this current state, and so the sequence\\nof samples z(1), z(2), . . . forms a Markov chain. Again, if we write p(z) = \\x04p(z)/Zp,\\nSection 11.2.1\\nwe will assume that \\x04p(z) can readily be evaluated for any given value of z, although\\nthe value of Zp may be unknown. The proposal distribution itself is chosen to be\\nsufﬁciently simple that it is straightforward to draw samples from it directly. At\\neach cycle of the algorithm, we generate a candidate sample z⋆from the proposal\\ndistribution and then accept the sample according to an appropriate criterion.\\nIn the basic Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), we assume that the\\nproposal distribution is symmetric, that is q(zA|zB) = q(zB|zA) for all values of\\nzA and zB. The candidate sample is then accepted with probability\\nA(z⋆, z(τ)) = min\\n\\x0f\\n1, \\x04p(z⋆)\\n\\x04p(z(τ))\\n\\x10\\n.\\n(11.33)\\nThis can be achieved by choosing a random number u with uniform distribution over\\nthe unit interval (0, 1) and then accepting the sample if A(z⋆, z(τ)) > u. Note that\\nif the step from z(τ) to z⋆causes an increase in the value of p(z), then the candidate\\npoint is certain to be kept.\\nIf the candidate sample is accepted, then z(τ+1) = z⋆, otherwise the candidate\\npoint z⋆is discarded, z(τ+1) is set to z(τ) and another candidate sample is drawn\\nfrom the distribution q(z|z(τ+1)). This is in contrast to rejection sampling, where re-\\njected samples are simply discarded. In the Metropolis algorithm when a candidate\\npoint is rejected, the previous sample is included instead in the ﬁnal list of samples,\\nleading to multiple copies of samples. Of course, in a practical implementation,\\nonly a single copy of each retained sample would be kept, along with an integer\\nweighting factor recording how many times that state appears. As we shall see, as\\nlong as q(zA|zB) is positive for any values of zA and zB (this is a sufﬁcient but\\nnot necessary condition), the distribution of z(τ) tends to p(z) as τ →∞. It should\\nbe emphasized, however, that the sequence z(1), z(2), . . . is not a set of independent\\nsamples from p(z) because successive samples are highly correlated. If we wish to\\nobtain independent samples, then we can discard most of the sequence and just re-\\ntain every M th sample. For M sufﬁciently large, the retained samples will for all\\npractical purposes be independent. Figure 11.9 shows a simple illustrative exam-\\nple of sampling from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution using the Metropolis\\nalgorithm in which the proposal distribution is an isotropic Gaussian.\\nFurther insight into the nature of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be\\ngleaned by looking at the properties of a speciﬁc example, namely a simple random'),\n",

In order to keep\\nthe rejection rate low, the scale ρ of the proposal\\ndistribution should be on the order of the smallest\\nstandard deviation σmin, which leads to random\\nwalk behaviour in which the number of steps sep-\\narating states that are approximately independent\\nis of order (σmax/σmin)2 where σmax is the largest\\nstandard deviation.\\nσmax\\nσmin\\nρ\\nproportion of accepted transitions will be high, but progress through the state space\\ntakes the form of a slow random walk leading to long correlation times. However,\\nif the variance parameter is large, then the rejection rate will be high because, in the\\nkind of complex problems we are considering, many of the proposed steps will be\\nto states for which the probability p(z) is low. Consider a multivariate distribution\\np(z) having strong correlations between the components of z, as illustrated in Fig-\\nure 11.10. The scale ρ of the proposal distribution should be as large as possible\\nwithout incurring high rejection rates. This suggests that ρ should be of the same\\norder as the smallest length scale σmin. The system then explores the distribution\\nalong the more extended direction by means of a random walk, and so the number\\nof steps to arrive at a state that is more or less independent of the original state is\\nof order (σmax/σmin)2. In fact in two dimensions, the increase in rejection rate as ρ\\nincreases is offset by the larger steps sizes of those transitions that are accepted, and\\nmore generally for a multivariate Gaussian the number of steps required to obtain\\nindependent samples scales like (σmax/σ2)2 where σ2 is the second-smallest stan-\\ndard deviation (Neal, 1993).

SAMPLING METHODS\\nTo show that this procedure samples from the required distribution, we ﬁrst of\\nall note that the distribution p(z) is an invariant of each of the Gibbs sampling steps\\nindividually and hence of the whole Markov chain. This follows from the fact that\\nwhen we sample from p(zi|{z\\\\i), the marginal distribution p(z\\\\i) is clearly invariant\\nbecause the value of z\\\\i is unchanged. Also, each step by deﬁnition samples from the\\ncorrect conditional distribution p(zi|z\\\\i). Because these conditional and marginal\\ndistributions together specify the joint distribution, we see that the joint distribution\\nis itself invariant.\\nThe second requirement to be satisﬁed in order that the Gibbs sampling proce-\\ndure samples from the correct distribution is that it be ergodic. A sufﬁcient condition\\nfor ergodicity is that none of the conditional distributions be anywhere zero. If this\\nis the case, then any point in z space can be reached from any other point in a ﬁnite\\nnumber of steps involving one update of each of the component variables. If this\\nrequirement is not satisﬁed, so that some of the conditional distributions have zeros,\\nthen ergodicity, if it applies, must be proven explicitly.\\nThe distribution of initial states must also be speciﬁed in order to complete the\\nalgorithm, although samples drawn after many iterations will effectively become\\nindependent of this distribution. Of course, successive samples from the Markov\\nchain will be highly correlated, and so to obtain samples that are nearly independent\\nit will be necessary to subsample the sequence.\\nWe can obtain the Gibbs sampling procedure as a particular instance of the\\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm as follows. Consider a Metropolis-Hastings sampling\\nstep involving the variable zk in which the remaining variables z\\\\k remain ﬁxed, and\\nfor which the transition probability from z to z⋆is given by qk(z⋆|z) = p(z⋆\\nk|z\\\\k).\\nWe note that z⋆\\n\\\\k = z\\\\k because these components are unchanged by the sampling\\nstep. Also, p(z) = p(zk|z\\\\k)p(z\\\\k). Thus the factor that determines the acceptance\\nprobability in the Metropolis-Hastings (11.44) is given by\\nA(z⋆, z) = p(z⋆)qk(z|z⋆)\\np(z)qk(z⋆|z) =\\np(z⋆\\nk|z⋆\\n\\\\k)p(z⋆\\n\\\\k)p(zk|z⋆\\n\\\\k)\\np(zk|z\\\\k)p(z\\\\k)p(z⋆\\nk|z\\\\k) = 1\\n(11.49)\\nwhere we have used z⋆\\n\\\\k = z\\\\k. Thus the Metropolis-Hastings steps are always\\naccepted.\\nAs with the Metropolis algorithm, we can gain some insight into the behaviour of\\nGibbs sampling by investigating its application to a Gaussian distribution. Consider\\na correlated Gaussian in two variables, as illustrated in Figure 11.11, having con-\\nditional distributions of width l and marginal distributions of width L. The typical\\nstep size is governed by the conditional distributions and will be of order l. Because\\nthe state evolves according to a random walk, the number of steps needed to obtain\\nindependent samples from the distribution will be of order (L/l)2. Of course if the\\nGaussian distribution were uncorrelated, then the Gibbs sampling procedure would\\nbe optimally efﬁcient. For this simple problem, we could rotate the coordinate sys-\\ntem in order to decorrelate the variables. However, in practical applications it will\\ngenerally be infeasible to ﬁnd such transformations.\\nOne approach to reducing random walk behaviour in Gibbs sampling is called\\nover-relaxation (Adler, 1981).

The number of steps needed\\nto obtain an independent sample from\\nthe distribution is O((L/l)2).\\nz1\\nz2\\nL\\nl\\nthe conditional distributions are Gaussian, which represents a more general class of\\ndistributions than the multivariate Gaussian because, for example, the non-Gaussian\\ndistribution p(z, y) ∝exp(−z2y2) has Gaussian conditional distributions. At each\\nstep of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, the conditional distribution for a particular\\ncomponent zi has some mean µi and some variance σ2\\ni . In the over-relaxation frame-\\nwork, the value of zi is replaced with\\nz′\\ni = µi + α(zi −µi) + σi(1 −α2\\ni)1/2ν\\n(11.50)\\nwhere ν is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and α\\nis a parameter such that −1 < α < 1. For α = 0, the method is equivalent to\\nstandard Gibbs sampling, and for α < 0 the step is biased to the opposite side of the\\nmean. This step leaves the desired distribution invariant because if zi has mean µi\\nand variance σ2\\ni , then so too does z′\\ni. The effect of over-relaxation is to encourage\\ndirected motion through state space when the variables are highly correlated. The\\nframework of ordered over-relaxation (Neal, 1999) generalizes this approach to non-\\nGaussian distributions.\\nThe practical applicability of Gibbs sampling depends on the ease with which\\nsamples can be drawn from the conditional distributions p(zk|z\\\\k).

SAMPLING METHODS\\nFigure 11.12\\nThe Gibbs sampling method requires samples\\nto be drawn from the conditional distribution of a variable condi-\\ntioned on the remaining variables. For graphical models, this\\nconditional distribution is a function only of the states of the\\nnodes in the Markov blanket. For an undirected graph this com-\\nprises the set of neighbours, as shown on the left, while for a\\ndirected graph the Markov blanket comprises the parents, the\\nchildren, and the co-parents, as shown on the right.\\ninal conditional distributions (conditioned on the parents) deﬁning each node, and\\nso standard sampling techniques can be employed. In general, the full conditional\\ndistributions will be of a complex form that does not permit the use of standard sam-\\npling algorithms. However, if these conditionals are log concave, then sampling can\\nbe done efﬁciently using adaptive rejection sampling (assuming the corresponding\\nvariable is a scalar).\\nIf, at each stage of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, instead of drawing a sample\\nfrom the corresponding conditional distribution, we make a point estimate of the\\nvariable given by the maximum of the conditional distribution, then we obtain the\\niterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm discussed in Section 8.3.3. Thus ICM\\ncan be seen as a greedy approximation to Gibbs sampling.\\nBecause the basic Gibbs sampling technique considers one variable at a time,\\nthere are strong dependencies between successive samples. At the opposite extreme,\\nif we could draw samples directly from the joint distribution (an operation that we\\nare supposing is intractable), then successive samples would be independent. We can\\nhope to improve on the simple Gibbs sampler by adopting an intermediate strategy in\\nwhich we sample successively from groups of variables rather than individual vari-\\nables. This is achieved in the blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm by choosing blocks\\nof variables, not necessarily disjoint, and then sampling jointly from the variables in\\neach block in turn, conditioned on the remaining variables (Jensen et al., 1995).\\n11.4. Slice Sampling\\nWe have seen that one of the difﬁculties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensi-\\ntivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random\\nwalk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inefﬁciency due to a high rejec-\\ntion rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size\\nthat is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again\\nit requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution \\x04p(z).\\nConsider ﬁrst the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with\\nan additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We\\nshall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in\\nSection 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution'),\n",

It is ap-\\nplicable to distributions over continuous variables for which we can readily evaluate\\nthe gradient of the log probability with respect to the state variables. We will discuss\\nthe dynamical systems framework in Section 11.5.1, and then in Section 11.5.2 we\\nexplain how this may be combined with the Metropolis algorithm to yield the pow-\\nerful hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm.

Noting\\nthat z and r are independent in the distribution p(z, r), we see that the conditional\\ndistribution p(r|z) is a Gaussian from which it is straightforward to sample.\\nExercise 11.16\\nIn a practical application of this approach, we have to address the problem of\\nperforming a numerical integration of the Hamiltonian equations. This will neces-\\nsarily introduce numerical errors and so we should devise a scheme that minimizes\\nthe impact of such errors. In fact, it turns out that integration schemes can be devised\\nfor which Liouville’s theorem still holds exactly. This property will be important in\\nthe hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which is discussed in Section 11.5.2. One scheme\\nfor achieving this is called the leapfrog discretization and involves alternately updat-\\ning discrete-time approximations \\x01z and \\x01r to the position and momentum variables\\nusing\\n\\x01ri(τ + ϵ/2)\\n=\\n\\x01ri(τ) −ϵ\\n2\\n∂E\\n∂zi\\n(\\x01z(τ))\\n(11.64)\\n\\x01zi(τ + ϵ)\\n=\\n\\x01zi(τ) + ϵ\\x01ri(τ + ϵ/2)\\n(11.65)\\n\\x01ri(τ + ϵ)\\n=\\n\\x01ri(τ + ϵ/2) −ϵ\\n2\\n∂E\\n∂zi\\n(\\x01z(τ + ϵ)).\\n(11.66)\\nWe see that this takes the form of a half-step update of the momentum variables with\\nstep size ϵ/2, followed by a full-step update of the position variables with step size ϵ,\\nfollowed by a second half-step update of the momentum variables. If several leapfrog\\nsteps are applied in succession, it can be seen that half-step updates to the momentum\\nvariables can be combined into full-step updates with step size ϵ. The successive\\nupdates to position and momentum variables then leapfrog over each other. In order\\nto advance the dynamics by a time interval τ, we need to take τ/ϵ steps. The error\\ninvolved in the discretized approximation to the continuous time dynamics will go to\\nzero, assuming a smooth function E(z), in the limit ϵ →0. However, for a nonzero\\nϵ as used in practice, some residual error will remain.

SAMPLING METHODS\\n11.5.2\\nHybrid Monte Carlo\\nAs we discussed in the previous section, for a nonzero step size ϵ, the discretiza-\\ntion of the leapfrog algorithm will introduce errors into the integration of the Hamil-\\ntonian dynamical equations. Hybrid Monte Carlo (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 1996)\\ncombines Hamiltonian dynamics with the Metropolis algorithm and thereby removes\\nany bias associated with the discretization.\\nSpeciﬁcally, the algorithm uses a Markov chain consisting of alternate stochastic\\nupdates of the momentum variable r and Hamiltonian dynamical updates using the\\nleapfrog algorithm. After each application of the leapfrog algorithm, the resulting\\ncandidate state is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion based\\non the value of the Hamiltonian H. Thus if (z, r) is the initial state and (z⋆, r⋆)\\nis the state after the leapfrog integration, then this candidate state is accepted with\\nprobability\\nmin (1, exp{H(z, r) −H(z⋆, r⋆)}) .\\n(11.67)\\nIf the leapfrog integration were to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics perfectly,\\nthen every such candidate step would automatically be accepted because the value\\nof H would be unchanged. Due to numerical errors, the value of H may sometimes\\ndecrease, and we would like the Metropolis criterion to remove any bias due to this\\neffect and ensure that the resulting samples are indeed drawn from the required dis-\\ntribution. In order for this to be the case, we need to ensure that the update equations\\ncorresponding to the leapfrog integration satisfy detailed balance (11.40). This is\\neasily achieved by modifying the leapfrog scheme as follows.\\nBefore the start of each leapfrog integration sequence, we choose at random,\\nwith equal probability, whether to integrate forwards in time (using step size ϵ) or\\nbackwards in time (using step size −ϵ). We ﬁrst note that the leapfrog integration\\nscheme (11.64), (11.65), and (11.66) is time-reversible, so that integration for L steps\\nusing step size −ϵ will exactly undo the effect of integration for L steps using step\\nsize ϵ. Next we show that the leapfrog integration preserves phase-space volume\\nexactly. This follows from the fact that each step in the leapfrog scheme updates\\neither a zi variable or an ri variable by an amount that is a function only of the other\\nvariable. As shown in Figure 11.14, this has the effect of shearing a region of phase\\nspace while not altering its volume.\\nFinally, we use these results to show that detailed balance holds. Consider a\\nsmall region R of phase space that, under a sequence of L leapfrog iterations of\\nstep size ϵ, maps to a region R′. Using conservation of volume under the leapfrog\\niteration, we see that if R has volume δV then so too will R′. If we choose an initial\\npoint from the distribution (11.63) and then update it using L leapfrog interactions,\\nthe probability of the transition going from R to R′ is given by\\n1\\nZH\\nexp(−H(R))δV 1\\n2 min {1, exp(−H(R) + H(R′))} .\\n(11.68)\\nwhere the factor of 1/2 arises from the probability of choosing to integrate with a\\npositive step size rather than a negative one. Similarly, the probability of starting in'),\n",

Using a\\nLagrange multiplier A2 to enforce the constraint, we consider the minimization of\\n(12.16)\\n(12.18)\\nExercise 12.2\\nAppendix A\\nSetting the derivative with respect to U2 to zero, we obtain SU2 =\\nA2U2 so that U2\\nis an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue A2. Thus any eigenvector will define a sta-\\ntionary point of the distortion measure. To find the value of J at the minimum, we\\nback-substitute the solution for U2 into the distortion measure to give J =\\nA2. We\\ntherefore obtain the minimum value of J by choosing U2 to be the eigenvector corre-\\nsponding to the smaller of the two eigenvalues. Thus we should choose the principal\\nsubspace to be aligned with the eigenvector having the larger eigenvalue. This result\\naccords with our intuition that, in order to minimize the average squared projection\\ndistance, we should choose the principal component subspace to pass through the\\nmean of the data points and to be aligned with the directions of maximum variance.\\nFor the case when the eigenvalues are equal, any choice of principal direction will\\ngive rise to the same value of J.\\nThe general solution to the minimization of J for arbitrary D and arbitrary M <\\nD is obtained by choosing the {Ui} to be eigenvectors of the covariance matrix given\\nby\\nSUi =\\nAiUi\\n(12.17)\\nwhere i = 1, ... ,D, and as usual the eigenvectors {Ui} are chosen to be orthonor-\\nmal. The corresponding value of the distortion measure is then given by\\nD\\nJ= L\\nAi\\ni=M+l\\nwhich is simply the sum of the eigenvalues of those eigenvectors that are orthogonal\\nto the principal subspace. We therefore obtain the minimum value of J by selecting\\nthese eigenvectors to be those having the D - M smallest eigenvalues, and hence\\nthe eigenvectors defining the principal subspace are those corresponding to the M\\nlargest eigenvalues.\\nAlthough we have considered M < D, the PCA analysis still holds if M\\n=\\nD, in which case there is no dimensionality reduction but simply a rotation of the\\ncoordinate axes to align with principal components.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that there exists a closely related linear dimensionality\\nreduction technique called canonical correlation analysis, or CCA (Hotelling, 1936;\\nBach and Jordan, 2002). Whereas PCA works with a single random variable, CCA\\nconsiders two (or more) variables and tries to find a corresponding pair of linear\\nsubspaces that have high cross-correlation, so that each component within one of the\\nsubspaces is correlated with a single component from the other subspace. Its solution\\ncan be expressed in terms of a generalized eigenvector problem.\\n12.1.3\\nApplications of peA\\nWe can illustrate the use of PCA for data compression by considering the off-\\nline digits data set.

If we substitute the solution for W into the expression for C, and make\\nuse of the orthogonality property RRT\\n= I, we see that C is independent of R.\\nThis simply says that the predictive density is unchanged by rotations in the latent\\nspace as discussed earlier. For the particular case of R = I, we see that the columns\\nof W are the principal component eigenvectors scaled by the variance parameters\\nAi -\\n(J\\'2. The interpretation of these scaling factors is clear once we recognize that\\nfor a convolution of independent Gaussian distributions (in this case the latent space\\ndistribution and the noise model) the variances are additive. Thus the variance Ai\\nin the direction of an eigenvector Ui is composed of the sum of a contribution Ai -\\n(J\\'2 from the projection of the unit-variance latent space distribution into data space\\nthrough the corresponding column of W, plus an isotropic contribution of variance\\n(J\\'2 which is added in all directions by the noise model.\\nIt is worth taking a moment to study the form of the covariance matrix given\\nby (12.36). Consider the variance of the predictive distribution along some direction\\nspecified by the unit vector v, where vTv =\\n1, which is given by vTCv. First\\nsuppose that v is orthogonal to the principal subspace, in other words it is given by\\nsome linear combination of the discarded eigenvectors. Then vTV = 0 and hence\\nvTCv =\\n(J\\'2. Thus the model predicts a noise variance orthogonal to the principal\\nsubspace, which, from (12.46), is just the average of the discarded eigenvalues. Now\\nsuppose that v =\\nUi where Ui is one of the retained eigenvectors defining the prin-\\ncipal subspace. Then vTCv = (Ai -\\n(J\\'2) + (J\\'2 = Ai. In other words, this model\\ncorrectly captures the variance of the data along the principal axes, and approximates\\nthe variance in all remaining directions with a single average value (J\\'2.\\nOne way to construct the maximum likelihood density model would simply be\\nto find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix and then to\\nevaluate Wand (J\\'2 using the results given above. In this case, we would choose\\nR = I for convenience. However, if the maximum likelihood solution is found by\\nnumerical optimization of the likelihood function, for instance using an algorithm\\nsuch as conjugate gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and\\nNabney, 2008) or through the EM algorithm, then the resulting value of R is es-\\nsentially arbitrary. This implies that the columns of W need not be orthogonal. If\\nan orthogonal basis is required, the matrix W can be post-processed appropriately\\n(Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Alternatively, the EM algorithm can be modified in\\nsuch a way as to yield orthonormal principal directions, sorted in descending order\\nof the corresponding eigenvalues, directly (Ahn and Oh, 2003).'),\n",

Here there is a continuum of parameters all of which lead to the\\nsame predictive density, in contrast to the discrete nonidentifiability associated with\\ncomponent re-labelling in the mixture setting.\\nIf we consider the case of M = D, so that there is no reduction of dimension-\\nality, then U M = U and L M = L. Making use of the orthogonality properties\\nUUT = I and RRT = I, we see that the covariance C of the marginal distribution\\nfor x becomes\\n(12.47)\\nand so we obtain the standard maximum likelihood solution for an unconstrained\\nGaussian distribution in which the covariance matrix is given by the sample covari-\\nance.\\nConventional PCA is generally formulated as a projection of points from the D-\\ndimensional data space onto an M -dimensional linear subspace. Probabilistic PCA,\\nhowever, is most naturally expressed as a mapping from the latent space into the data\\nspace via (12.33). For applications such as visualization and data compression, we\\ncan reverse this mapping using Bayes' theorem. Any point x in data space can then\\nbe summarized by its posterior mean and covariance in latent space. From (12.42)\\nthe mean is given by\\nwhere M is given by (12.41).

However, each cycle of the EM\\nalgorithm can be computationally much more efficient than conventional PCA in\\nspaces of high dimensionality. To see this, we note that the eigendecomposition of\\nthe covariance matrix requires O(D3 ) computation. Often we are interested only\\nin the first M eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues, in which case we\\ncan use algorithms that are 0 (MD 2 ). However, the evaluation of the covariance\\nmatrix itself takes 0 (ND 2 ) computations, where N is the number of data points.\\nAlgorithms such as the snapshot method (Sirovich, 1987), which assume that the\\neigenvectors are linear combinations of the data vectors, avoid direct evaluation of\\nthe covariance matrix but are O(N3 ) and hence unsuited to large data sets. The EM\\nalgorithm described here also does not construct the covariance matrix explicitly.\\nInstead, the most computationally demanding steps are those involving sums over\\nthe data set that are 0 (NDM). For large D, and M « D, this can be a significant\\nsaving compared to 0 (ND 2 ) and can offset the iterative nature of the EM algorithm.\\nNote that this EM algorithm can be implemented in an on-line form in which\\neach D-dimensional data point is read in and processed and then discarded before\\nthe next data point is considered. To see this, note that the quantities evaluated in\\nthe E step (an M-dimensional vector and an M x M matrix) can be computed for\\neach data point separately, and in the M step we need to accumulate sums over data\\npoints, which we can do incrementally. This approach can be advantageous if both\\nNand D are large.\\nBecause we now have a fully probabilistic model for PCA, we can deal with\\nmissing data, provided that it is missing at random, by marginalizing over the dis-\\ntribution of the unobserved variables. Again these missing values can be treated\\nusing the EM algorithm. We give an example of the use of this approach for data\\nvisualization in Figure 12.11.\\nAnother elegant feature ofthe EM approach is that we can take the limit a 2\\n----t 0,\\ncorresponding to standard PCA, and still obtain a valid EM-like algorithm (Roweis,\\n1998). From (12.55), we see that the only quantity we need to compute in the Estep\\nis JE[zn]. Furthermore, the M step is simplifie~ because M = WTW. To emphasize\\nthe simplicity of the algorithm, let us define X to be a matrix of size N x D whose\\nnth row is given by the vector X n - x and similarly define 0 to be a matrix of size\\nD x M whose nth row is given by the vector JE[zn]. The Estep (12.54) of the EM\\nalgorithm for PCA then becomes\\no =\\n(W~dWold)-lW~dX\\nand the M step (12.56) takes the form\\nW new = XTOT(OOT)-l.\\n(12.59)\\nAgain these can be implemented in an on-line form. These equations have a simple\\ninterpretation as follows. From our earlier discussion, we see that the E step involves\\nan orthogonal projection of the data points onto the current estimate for the principal\\nsubspace.

Nonlinear Latent Variable Models\\n591\\n12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models\\nExercise 12.28\\nIn this chapter, we have focussed on the simplest class of models having continuous\\nlatent variables, namely those based on linear-Gaussian distributions. As well as\\nhaving great practical importance, these models are relatively easy to analyse and\\nto fit to data and can also be used as components in more complex models. Here\\nwe consider briefly some generalizations of this framework to models that are either\\nnonlinear or non-Gaussian, or both.\\nIn fact, the issues of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity are related because a\\ngeneral probability density can be obtained from a simple fixed reference density,\\nsuch as a Gaussian, by making a nonlinear change of variables. This idea forms the\\nbasis of several practical latent variable models as we shall see shortly.\\n12.4.1\\nIndependent component analysis\\nWe begin by considering models in which the observed variables are related\\nlinearly to the latent variables, but for which the latent distribution is non-Gaussian.\\nAn important class of such models, known as independent component analysis, or\\nleA, arises when we consider a distribution over the latent variables that factorizes,\\nso that\\nM\\np(z) = IIp(Zj).\\nj=l\\n(12.89)\\nTo understand the role of such models, consider a situation in which two people\\nare talking at the same time, and we record their voices using two microphones.\\nIf we ignore effects such as time delay and echoes, then the signals received by\\nthe microphones at any point in time will be given by linear combinations of the\\namplitudes of the two voices. The coefficients of this linear combination will be\\nconstant, and if we can infer their values from sample data, then we can invert the\\nmixing process (assuming it is nonsingular) and thereby obtain two clean signals\\neach of which contains the voice ofjust one person. This is an example of a problem\\ncalled blind source separation in which 'blind' refers to the fact that we are given\\nonly the mixed data, and neither the original sources nor the mixing coefficients are\\nobserved (Cardoso, 1998).\\nThis type of problem is sometimes addressed using the following approach\\n(MacKay, 2003) in which we ignore the temporal nature of the signals and treat the\\nsuccessive samples as i.i.d. We consider a generative model in which there are two\\nlatent variables corresponding to the unobserved speech signal amplitudes, and there\\nare two observed variables given by the signal values at the microphones. The latent\\nvariables have a joint distribution that factorizes as above, and the observed variables\\nare given by a linear combination of the latent variables. There is no need to include\\na noise distribution because the number of latent variables equals the number of ob-\\nserved variables, and therefore the marginal distribution of the observed variables\\nwill not in general be singular, so the observed variables are simply deterministic\\nlinear combinations of the latent variables.

CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES\\nExercise 12.29\\nlikelihood function for this model is a function of the coefficients in the linear com-\\nbination. The log likelihood can be maximized using gradient-based optimization\\ngiving rise to a particular version of independent component analysis.\\nThe success of this approach requires that the latent variables have non-Gaussian\\ndistributions. To see this, recall that in probabilistic PCA (and in factor analysis) the\\nlatent-space distribution is given by a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian.\\nThe model\\ntherefore cannot distinguish between two different choices for the latent variables\\nwhere these differ simply by a rotation in latent space. This can be verified directly\\nby noting that the marginal density (12.35), and hence the likelihood function, is\\nunchanged if we make the transformation W -) WR where R is an orthogonal\\nmatrix satisfying RRT = I, because the matrix C given by (12.36) is itself invariant.\\nExtending the model to allow more general Gaussian latent distributions does not\\nchange this conclusion because, as we have seen, such a model is equivalent to the\\nzero-mean isotropic Gaussian latent variable model.\\nAnother way to see why a Gaussian latent variable distribution in a linear model\\nis insufficient to find independent components is to note that the principal compo-\\nnents represent a rotation of the coordinate system in data space such as to diagonal-\\nize the covariance matrix, so that the data distribution in the new coordinates is then\\nuncorrelated. Although zero correlation is a necessary condition for independence\\nit is not, however, sufficient. In practice, a common choice for the latent-variable\\ndistribution is given by\\n1\\np(z) = --,.-----,-\\nJ\\n7fcosh(zj)\\n1\\n(12.90)\\nwhich has heavy tails compared to a Gaussian, reflecting the observation that many\\nreal-world distributions also exhibit this property.\\nThe original ICA model (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) was based on the optimiza-\\ntion of an objective function defined by information maximization. One advantage\\nof a probabilistic latent variable formulation is that it helps to motivate and formu-\\nlate generalizations of basic ICA. For instance, independent factor analysis (Attias,\\n1999a) considers a model in which the number of latent and observed variables can\\ndiffer, the observed variables are noisy, and the individual latent variables have flex-\\nible distributions modelled by mixtures of Gaussians. The log likelihood for this\\nmodel is maximized using EM, and the reconstruction of the latent variables is ap-\\nproximated using a variational approach.\\nMany other types of model have been\\nconsidered, and there is now a huge literature on ICA and its applications (Jutten\\nand Herault, 1991; Comon et at., 1991; Amari et at., 1996; Pearlmutter and Parra,\\n1997; Hyvarinen and Oja, 1997; Hinton et at., 2001; Miskin and MacKay, 2001;\\nHojen-Sorensen et at., 2002; Choudrey and Roberts, 2003; Chan et at., 2003; Stone,\\n2004).\\n12.4.2\\nAutoassociative neural networks\\nIn Chapter 5 we considered neural networks in the context of supervised learn-\\ning, where the role of the network is to predict the output variables given values'),\n",

The targets used\\nto train the network are simply the input vectors themselves, so that the network\\nis attempting to map each input vector onto itself. Such a network is said to form\\nan autoassociative mapping. Since the number of hidden units is smaller than the\\nnumber of inputs, a perfect reconstruction of all input vectors is not in general pos-\\nsible. We therefore determine the network parameters w by minimizing an error\\nfunction which captures the degree of mismatch between the input vectors and their\\nreconstructions.

Thus, the vectors of weights which lead into the hidden units in Figure 12.18\\nform a basis set which spans the principal subspace. Note, however, that these vec-\\ntors need not be orthogonal or normalized. This result is unsurprising, since both\\nprincipal component analysis and the neural network are using linear dimensionality\\nreduction and are minimizing the same sum-of-squares error function.\\nIt might be thought that the limitations of a linear dimensionality reduction could\\nbe overcome by using nonlinear (sigmoidal) activation functions for the hidden units\\nin the network in Figure 12.18. However, even with nonlinear hidden units, the min-\\nimum error solution is again given by the projection onto the principal component\\nsubspace (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988). There is therefore no advantage in using two-\\nlayer neural networks to perform dimensionality reduction. Standard techniques for\\nprincipal component analysis (based on singular value decomposition) are guaran-\\nteed to give the correct solution in finite time, and they also generate an ordered set\\nof eigenvalues with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors.'),\n",

Nonlinear Latent Variable Models\\n595\\nIt has the advantage of not being limited to linear transformations, although it con-\\ntains standard principal component analysis as a special case. However, training\\nthe network now involves a nonlinear optimization problem, since the error function\\n(12.91) is no longer a quadratic function of the network parameters. Computation-\\nally intensive nonlinear optimization techniques must be used, and there is the risk of\\nfinding a suboptimal local minimum of the error function. Also, the dimensionality\\nof the subspace must be specified before training the network.\\n12.4.3\\nModelling nonlinear manifolds\\nAs we have already noted, many natural sources of data correspond to low-\\ndimensional, possibly noisy, nonlinear manifolds embedded within the higher di-\\nmensional observed data space. Capturing this property explicitly can lead to im-\\nproved density modelling compared with more general methods. Here we consider\\nbriefly a range of techniques that attempt to do this.\\nOne way to model the nonlinear structure is through a combination of linear\\nmodels, so that we make a piece-wise linear approximation to the manifold. This can\\nbe obtained, for instance, by using a clustering technique such as K -means based on\\nEuclidean distance to partition the data set into local groups with standard PCA ap-\\nplied to each group. A better approach is to use the reconstruction error for cluster\\nassignment (Kambhatla and Leen, 1997; Hinton et al., 1997) as then a common cost\\nfunction is being optimized in each stage. However, these approaches still suffer\\nfrom limitations due to the absence of an overall density model. By using prob-\\nabilistic PCA it is straightforward to define a fully probabilistic model simply by\\nconsidering a mixture distribution in which the components are probabilistic PCA\\nmodels (Tipping and Bishop, 1999a). Such a model has both discrete latent vari-\\nables, corresponding to the discrete mixture, as well as continuous latent variables,\\nand the likelihood function can be maximized using the EM algorithm.\\nA fully\\nBayesian treatment, based on variational inference (Bishop and Winn, 2000), allows\\nthe number of components in the mixture, as well as the effective dimensionalities\\nof the individual models, to be inferred from the data. There are many variants of\\nthis model in which parameters such as the W matrix or the noise variances are tied\\nacross components in the mixture, or in which the isotropic noise distributions are\\nreplaced by diagonal ones, giving rise to a mixture of factor analysers (Ghahramani\\nand Hinton, 1996a; Ghahramani and Beal, 2000). The mixture of probabilistic PCA\\nmodels can also be extended hierarchically to produce an interactive data visualiza-\\ntion algorithm (Bishop and Tipping, 1998).\\nAn alternative to considering a mixture of linear models is to consider a single\\nnonlinear model. Recall that conventional PCA finds a linear subspace that passes\\nclose to the data in a least-squares sense.\\nThis concept can be extended to one-\\ndimensional nonlinear surfaces in the form of principal curves (Hastie and Stuetzle,\\n1989). We can describe a curve in a D-dimensional data space using a vector-valued\\nfunction f ().), which is a vector each of whose elements is a function of the scalar )..\\nThere are many possible ways to parameterize the curve, of which a natural choice\\nis the arc length along the curve. For any given point xin data space, we can find\\nthe point on the curve that is closest in Euclidean distance. We denote this point by'),\n",

CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES\\n>.. = gf(X) because it depends on the particular curve f(>\"). For a continuous data\\ndensity p(x), a principal curve is defined as one for which every point on the curve\\nis the mean of all those points in data space that project to it, so that\\nJE [Xlgf(X) = >..] = f(>\").\\n(12.92)\\nFor a given continuous density, there can be many principal curves. In practice, we\\nare interested in finite data sets, and we also wish to restrict attention to smooth\\ncurves. Hastie and Stuetzle (1989) propose a two-stage iterative procedure for find-\\ning such principal curves, somewhat reminiscent of the EM algorithm for PCA. The\\ncurve is initialized using the first principal component, and then the algorithm alter-\\nnates between a data projection step and curve re-estimation step. In the projection\\nstep, each data point is assigned to a value of >.. corresponding to the closest point\\non the curve. Then in the re-estimation step, each point on the curve is given by\\na weighted average of those points that project to nearby points on the curve, with\\npoints closest on the curve given the greatest weight. In the case where the subspace\\nis constrained to be linear, the procedure converges to the first principal component\\nand is equivalent to the power method for finding the largest eigenvector of the co-\\nvariance matrix. Principal curves can be generalized to multidimensional manifolds\\ncalled principal surfaces although these have found limited use due to the difficulty\\nof data smoothing in higher dimensions even for two-dimensional manifolds.\\nPCA is often used to project a data set onto a lower-dimensional space, for ex-\\nample two dimensional, for the purposes of visualization. Another linear technique\\nwith a similar aim is multidimensional scaling, or MDS (Cox and Cox, 2000). It finds\\na low-dimensional projection of the data such as to preserve, as closely as possible,\\nthe pairwise distances between data points, and involves finding the eigenvectors of\\nthe distance matrix. In the case where the distances are Euclidean, it gives equivalent\\nresults to PCA. The MDS concept can be extended to a wide variety of data types\\nspecified in terms of a similarity matrix, giving nonmetric MDS.\\nTwo other nonprobabilistic methods for dimensionality reduction and data vi-\\nsualization are worthy of mention. Locally linear embedding, or LLE (Roweis and\\nSaul, 2000) first computes the set of coefficients that best reconstructs each data\\npoint from its neighbours. These coefficients are arranged to be invariant to rota-\\ntions, translations, and scalings of that data point and its neighbours, and hence they\\ncharacterize the local geometrical properties of the neighbourhood. LLE then maps\\nthe high-dimensional data points down to a lower dimensional space while preserv-\\ning these neighbourhood coefficients. If the local neighbourhood for a particular\\ndata point can be considered linear, then the transformation can be achieved using\\na combination of translation, rotation, and scaling, such as to preserve the angles\\nformed between the data points and their neighbours. Because the weights are in-\\nvariant to these transformations, we expect the same weight values to reconstruct the\\ndata points in the low-dimensional space as in the high-dimensional data space. In\\nspite of the nonlinearity, the optimization for LLE does not exhibit local minima.\\nIn isometric feature mapping, or isomap (Tenenbaum et ai., 2000), the goal is\\nto project the data to a lower-dimensional space using MDS, but where the dissim-\\nilarities are defined in terms of the geodesic distances measured along the mani-'),\n",

For instance, if two points lie on a circle, then the geodesic is the arc-length\\ndistance measured around the circumference of the circle not the straight line dis-\\ntance measured along the chord connecting them. The algorithm first defines the\\nneighbourhood for each data point, either by finding the K nearest neighbours or by\\nfinding all points within a sphere of radius E. A graph is then constructed by link-\\ning all neighbouring points and labelling them with their Euclidean distance. The\\ngeodesic distance between any pair of points is then approximated by the sum of\\nthe arc lengths along the shortest path connecting them (which itself is found using\\nstandard algorithms). Finally, metric MDS is applied to the geodesic distance matrix\\nto find the low-dimensional projection.\\nOur focus in this chapter has been on models for which the observed vari-\\nables are continuous. We can also consider models having continuous latent vari-\\nables together with discrete observed variables, giving rise to latent trait models\\n(Bartholomew, 1987). In this case, the marginalization over the continuous latent\\nvariables, even for a linear relationship between latent and observed variables, can-\\nnot be performed analytically, and so more sophisticated techniques are required.\\nTipping (1999) uses variational inference in a model with a two-dimensional latent\\nspace, allowing a binary data set to be visualized analogously to the use of PCA to\\nvisualize continuous data. Note that this model is the dual of the Bayesian logistic\\nregression problem discussed in Section 4.5. In the case of logistic regression we\\nhave N observations of the feature vector <l>n which are parameterized by a single\\nparameter vector w, whereas in the latent space visualization model there is a single\\nlatent space variable x (analogous to <1» and N copies of the latent variable W n . A\\ngeneralization of probabilistic latent variable models to general exponential family\\ndistributions is described in Collins et al. (2002).\\nWe have already noted that an arbitrary distribution can be formed by taking a\\nGaussian random variable and transforming it through a suitable nonlinearity. This\\nis exploited in a general latent variable model called a density network (MacKay,\\n1995; MacKay and Gibbs, 1999) in which the nonlinear function is governed by a\\nmultilayered neural network. If the network has enough hidden units, it can approx-\\nimate a given nonlinear function to any desired accuracy. The downside of having\\nsuch a flexible model is that the marginalization over the latent variables, required in\\norder to obtain the likelihood function, is no longer analytically tractable. Instead,\\nthe likelihood is approximated using Monte Carlo techniques by drawing samples\\nfrom the Gaussian prior. The marginalization over the latent variables then becomes\\na simple sum with one term for each sample. However, because a large number\\nof sample points may be required in order to give an accurate representation of the\\nmarginal, this procedure can be computationally costly.\\nIf we consider more restricted forms for the nonlinear function, and make an ap-\\npropriate choice of the latent variable distribution, then we can construct a latent vari-\\nable model that is both nonlinear and efficient to train. The generative topographic\\nmapping, or GTM (Bishop et aI., 1996; Bishop et aI., 1997a; Bishop et aI., 1998b)\\nuses a latent distribution that is defined by a finite regular grid of delta functions over\\nthe (typically two-dimensional) latent space. Marginalization over the latent space\\nthen simply involves summing over the contributions from each of the grid locations.'),\n",

We can similarly\\nconsider extensions to an M th order Markov chain in which the conditional distri-\\nbution for a particular variable depends on the previous M variables. However, we\\nhave paid a price for this increased ﬂexibility because the number of parameters in\\nthe model is now much larger. Suppose the observations are discrete variables hav-\\ning K states. Then the conditional distribution p(xn|xn−1) in a ﬁrst-order Markov\\nchain will be speciﬁed by a set of K −1 parameters for each of the K states of xn−1\\ngiving a total of K(K −1) parameters. Now suppose we extend the model to an\\nM th order Markov chain, so that the joint distribution is built up from conditionals\\np(xn|xn−M, . . . , xn−1). If the variables are discrete, and if the conditional distri-\\nbutions are represented by general conditional probability tables, then the number\\nof parameters in such a model will have KM−1(K −1) parameters. Because this\\ngrows exponentially with M, it will often render this approach impractical for larger\\nvalues of M.\\nFor continuous variables, we can use linear-Gaussian conditional distributions\\nin which each node has a Gaussian distribution whose mean is a linear function\\nof its parents. This is known as an autoregressive or AR model (Box et al., 1994;\\nThiesson et al., 2004). An alternative approach is to use a parametric model for\\np(xn|xn−M, . . . , xn−1) such as a neural network.\\nThis technique is sometimes\\ncalled a tapped delay line because it corresponds to storing (delaying) the previous\\nM values of the observed variable in order to predict the next value. The number\\nof parameters can then be much smaller than in a completely general model (for ex-\\nample it may grow linearly with M), although this is achieved at the expense of a\\nrestricted family of conditional distributions.\\nSuppose we wish to build a model for sequences that is not limited by the\\nMarkov assumption to any order and yet that can be speciﬁed using a limited number\\nof free parameters. We can achieve this by introducing additional latent variables to\\npermit a rich class of models to be constructed out of simple components, as we did\\nwith mixture distributions in Chapter 9 and with continuous latent variable models in\\nChapter 12. For each observation xn, we introduce a corresponding latent variable\\nzn (which may be of different type or dimensionality to the observed variable). We\\nnow assume that it is the latent variables that form a Markov chain, giving rise to the\\ngraphical structure known as a state space model, which is shown in Figure 13.5.

Thus the predictive distribution p(xn+1|x1, . . . , xn) for observation xn+1\\ngiven all previous observations does not exhibit any conditional independence prop-\\nerties, and so our predictions for xn+1 depends on all previous observations. The\\nobserved variables, however, do not satisfy the Markov property at any order. We\\nshall discuss how to evaluate the predictive distribution in later sections of this chap-\\nter.\\nThere are two important models for sequential data that are described by this\\ngraph. If the latent variables are discrete, then we obtain the hidden Markov model,\\nor HMM (Elliott et al., 1995). Note that the observed variables in an HMM may\\nSection 13.2\\nbe discrete or continuous, and a variety of different conditional distributions can be\\nused to model them. If both the latent and the observed variables are Gaussian (with\\na linear-Gaussian dependence of the conditional distributions on their parents), then\\nwe obtain the linear dynamical system.\\nSection 13.3\\n13.2. Hidden Markov Models\\nThe hidden Markov model can be viewed as a speciﬁc instance of the state space\\nmodel of Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete. However, if we\\nexamine a single time slice of the model, we see that it corresponds to a mixture\\ndistribution, with component densities given by p(x|z). It can therefore also be\\ninterpreted as an extension of a mixture model in which the choice of mixture com-\\nponent for each observation is not selected independently but depends on the choice\\nof component for the previous observation. The HMM is widely used in speech\\nrecognition (Jelinek, 1997; Rabiner and Juang, 1993), natural language modelling\\n(Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), on-line handwriting recognition (Nag et al., 1986),\\nand for the analysis of biological sequences such as proteins and DNA (Krogh et al.,\\n1994; Durbin et al., 1998; Baldi and Brunak, 2001).\\nAs in the case of a standard mixture model, the latent variables are the discrete\\nmultinomial variables zn describing which component of the mixture is responsible\\nfor generating the corresponding observation xn. Again, it is convenient to use a\\n1-of-K coding scheme, as used for mixture models in Chapter 9. We now allow the\\nprobability distribution of zn to depend on the state of the previous latent variable\\nzn−1 through a conditional distribution p(zn|zn−1). Because the latent variables are\\nK-dimensional binary variables, this conditional distribution corresponds to a table\\nof numbers that we denote by A, the elements of which are known as transition\\nprobabilities. They are given by Ajk ≡p(znk = 1|zn−1,j = 1), and because they\\nare probabilities, they satisfy 0 ⩽Ajk ⩽1 with \\x05\\nk Ajk = 1, so that the matrix A'),\n",

Bottom row: synthetic digits sam-\\npled generatively from a left-to-right hid-\\nden Markov model that has been trained\\non a data set of 45 handwritten digits.\\nOne of the most powerful properties of hidden Markov models is their ability to\\nexhibit some degree of invariance to local warping (compression and stretching) of\\nthe time axis. To understand this, consider the way in which the digit ‘2’ is written\\nin the on-line handwritten digits example. A typical digit comprises two distinct\\nsections joined at a cusp. The ﬁrst part of the digit, which starts at the top left, has a\\nsweeping arc down to the cusp or loop at the bottom left, followed by a second more-\\nor-less straight sweep ending at the bottom right. Natural variations in writing style\\nwill cause the relative sizes of the two sections to vary, and hence the location of the\\ncusp or loop within the temporal sequence will vary. From a generative perspective\\nsuch variations can be accommodated by the hidden Markov model through changes\\nin the number of transitions to the same state versus the number of transitions to the\\nsuccessive state. Note, however, that if a digit ‘2’ is written in the reverse order, that\\nis, starting at the bottom right and ending at the top left, then even though the pen tip\\ncoordinates may be identical to an example from the training set, the probability of\\nthe observations under the model will be extremely small. In the speech recognition\\ncontext, warping of the time axis is associated with natural variations in the speed of\\nspeech, and again the hidden Markov model can accommodate such a distortion and\\nnot penalize it too heavily.\\n13.2.1\\nMaximum likelihood for the HMM\\nIf we have observed a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we can determine the param-\\neters of an HMM using maximum likelihood.

Nor can we perform the summations explicitly\\nbecause there are N variables to be summed over, each of which has K states, re-\\nsulting in a total of KN terms.

We shall therefore begin in this section with a ‘con-\\nventional’ derivation of the forward-backward equations, making use of the sum\\nand product rules of probability, and exploiting conditional independence properties\\nwhich we shall obtain from the corresponding graphical model using d-separation.\\nThen in Section 13.2.3, we shall see how the forward-backward algorithm can be\\nobtained very simply as a speciﬁc example of the sum-product algorithm introduced\\nin Section 8.4.4.\\nIt is worth emphasizing that evaluation of the posterior distributions of the latent\\nvariables is independent of the form of the emission density p(x|z) or indeed of\\nwhether the observed variables are continuous or discrete. All we require is the\\nvalues of the quantities p(xn|zn) for each value of zn for every n. Also, in this\\nsection and the next we shall omit the explicit dependence on the model parameters\\nθold because these ﬁxed throughout.\\nWe therefore begin by writing down the following conditional independence\\nproperties (Jordan, 2007)\\np(X|zn)\\n=\\np(x1, . . . , xn|zn)\\np(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)\\n(13.24)\\np(x1, . . . , xn−1|xn, zn)\\n=\\np(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn)\\n(13.25)\\np(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1, zn)\\n=\\np(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)\\n(13.26)\\np(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1)\\n=\\np(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1)\\n(13.27)\\np(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1, xn+1)\\n=\\np(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1)\\n(13.28)\\np(X|zn−1, zn)\\n=\\np(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)\\np(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) (13.29)\\np(xN+1|X, zN+1)\\n=\\np(xN+1|zN+1)\\n(13.30)\\np(zN+1|zN, X)\\n=\\np(zN+1|zN)\\n(13.31)\\nwhere X = {x1, . . . , xN}. These relations are most easily proved using d-separation.\\nFor instance in the ﬁrst of these results, we note that every path from any one of the\\nnodes x1, . . . , xn−1 to the node xn passes through the node zn, which is observed.\\nBecause all such paths are head-to-tail, it follows that the conditional independence\\nproperty must hold. The reader should take a few moments to verify each of these\\nproperties in turn, as an exercise in the application of d-separation. These relations\\ncan also be proved directly, though with signiﬁcantly greater effort, from the joint\\ndistribution for the hidden Markov model using the sum and product rules of proba-\\nbility.\\nExercise 13.10\\nLet us begin by evaluating γ(znk).

Recall that to compute the\\nlikelihood we should take the joint distribution p(X, Z) and sum over all possible\\nvalues of Z. Each such value represents a particular choice of hidden state for every\\ntime step, in other words every term in the summation is a path through the lattice\\ndiagram, and recall that there are exponentially many such paths. By expressing\\nthe likelihood function in the form (13.42), we have reduced the computational cost\\nfrom being exponential in the length of the chain to being linear by swapping the\\norder of the summation and multiplications, so that at each time step n we sum\\nthe contributions from all paths passing through each of the states znk to give the\\nintermediate quantities α(zn).\\nNext we consider the evaluation of the quantities ξ(zn−1, zn), which correspond\\nto the values of the conditional probabilities p(zn−1, zn|X) for each of the K × K\\nsettings for (zn−1, zn).

We ﬁrst make an initial selection of the parameters θold where\\nθ ≡(π, A, φ). The A and π parameters are often initialized either uniformly or\\nrandomly from a uniform distribution (respecting their non-negativity and summa-\\ntion constraints). Initialization of the parameters φ will depend on the form of the\\ndistribution. For instance in the case of Gaussians, the parameters µk might be ini-\\ntialized by applying the K-means algorithm to the data, and Σk might be initialized\\nto the covariance matrix of the corresponding K means cluster. Then we run both\\nthe forward α recursion and the backward β recursion and use the results to evaluate\\nγ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn). At this stage, we can also evaluate the likelihood function.'),\n",

From the recursion relation (13.36), we note\\nthat at each step the new value α(zn) is obtained from the previous value α(zn−1)\\nby multiplying by quantities p(zn|zn−1) and p(xn|zn). Because these probabilities\\nare often signiﬁcantly less than unity, as we work our way forward along the chain,\\nthe values of α(zn) can go to zero exponentially quickly. For moderate lengths of\\nchain (say 100 or so), the calculation of the α(zn) will soon exceed the dynamic\\nrange of the computer, even if double precision ﬂoating point is used.\\nIn the case of i.i.d. data, we implicitly circumvented this problem with the eval-\\nuation of likelihood functions by taking logarithms. Unfortunately, this will not help\\nhere because we are forming sums of products of small numbers (we are in fact im-\\nplicitly summing over all possible paths through the lattice diagram of Figure 13.7).\\nWe therefore work with re-scaled versions of α(zn) and β(zn) whose values remain\\nof order unity. As we shall see, the corresponding scaling factors cancel out when\\nwe use these re-scaled quantities in the EM algorithm.\\nIn (13.34), we deﬁned α(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn) representing the joint distri-\\nbution of all the observations up to xn and the latent variable zn. Now we deﬁne a\\nnormalized version of α given by\\n\\x01α(zn) = p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) =\\nα(zn)\\np(x1, . . . , xn)\\n(13.55)\\nwhich we expect to be well behaved numerically because it is a probability distribu-\\ntion over K variables for any value of n.

This α–γ recursion\\nrequires that the forward pass be completed ﬁrst so that all the quantities \\x01α(zn)\\nare available for the backward pass, whereas the forward and backward passes of\\nthe α–β algorithm can be done independently. Although these two algorithms have\\ncomparable computational cost, the α–β version is the most commonly encountered\\none in the case of hidden Markov models, whereas for linear dynamical systems a\\nSection 13.3\\nrecursion analogous to the α–γ form is more usual.\\n13.2.5\\nThe Viterbi algorithm\\nIn many applications of hidden Markov models, the latent variables have some\\nmeaningful interpretation, and so it is often of interest to ﬁnd the most probable\\nsequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. For instance in speech\\nrecognition, we might wish to ﬁnd the most probable phoneme sequence for a given\\nseries of acoustic observations. Because the graph for the hidden Markov model is\\na directed tree, this problem can be solved exactly using the max-sum algorithm.\\nWe recall from our discussion in Section 8.4.5 that the problem of ﬁnding the most\\nprobable sequence of latent states is not the same as that of ﬁnding the set of states\\nthat are individually the most probable. The latter problem can be solved by ﬁrst\\nrunning the forward-backward (sum-product) algorithm to ﬁnd the latent variable\\nmarginals γ(zn) and then maximizing each of these individually (Duda et al., 2001).\\nHowever, the set of such states will not, in general, correspond to the most probable\\nsequence of states. In fact, this set of states might even represent a sequence having\\nzero probability, if it so happens that two successive states, which in isolation are\\nindividually the most probable, are such that the transition matrix element connecting\\nthem is zero.\\nIn practice, we are usually interested in ﬁnding the most probable sequence of\\nstates, and this can be solved efﬁciently using the max-sum algorithm, which in the\\ncontext of hidden Markov models is known as the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967).\\nNote that the max-sum algorithm works with log probabilities and so there is no\\nneed to use re-scaled variables as was done with the forward-backward algorithm.\\nFigure 13.16 shows a fragment of the hidden Markov model expanded as lattice\\ndiagram. As we have already noted, the number of possible paths through the lattice\\ngrows exponentially with the length of the chain. The Viterbi algorithm searches this\\nspace of paths efﬁciently to ﬁnd the most probable path with a computational cost\\nthat grows only linearly with the length of the chain.\\nAs with the sum-product algorithm, we ﬁrst represent the hidden Markov model\\nas a factor graph, as shown in Figure 13.15. Again, we treat the variable node zN\\nas the root, and pass messages to the root starting with the leaf nodes. Using the\\nresults (8.93) and (8.94), we see that the messages passed in the max-sum algorithm\\nare given by\\nµzn→fn+1(zn)\\n=\\nµfn→zn(zn)\\n(13.66)\\nµfn+1→zn+1(zn+1)\\n=\\nmax\\nzn\\n\\x1a\\nln fn+1(zn, zn+1) + µzn→fn+1(zn)\\x1b\\n.

Hidden Markov Models\\n631\\nIntuitively, we can understand the Viterbi algorithm as follows. Naively, we\\ncould consider explicitly all of the exponentially many paths through the lattice,\\nevaluate the probability for each, and then select the path having the highest proba-\\nbility. However, we notice that we can make a dramatic saving in computational cost\\nas follows. Suppose that for each path we evaluate its probability by summing up\\nproducts of transition and emission probabilities as we work our way forward along\\neach path through the lattice. Consider a particular time step n and a particular state\\nk at that time step. There will be many possible paths converging on the correspond-\\ning node in the lattice diagram. However, we need only retain that particular path\\nthat so far has the highest probability. Because there are K states at time step n, we\\nneed to keep track of K such paths. At time step n + 1, there will be K2 possible\\npaths to consider, comprising K possible paths leading out of each of the K current\\nstates, but again we need only retain K of these corresponding to the best path for\\neach state at time n+1. When we reach the ﬁnal time step N we will discover which\\nstate corresponds to the overall most probable path. Because there is a unique path\\ncoming into that state we can trace the path back to step N −1 to see what state it\\noccupied at that time, and so on back through the lattice to the state n = 1.\\n13.2.6\\nExtensions of the hidden Markov model\\nThe basic hidden Markov model, along with the standard training algorithm\\nbased on maximum likelihood, has been extended in numerous ways to meet the\\nrequirements of particular applications. Here we discuss a few of the more important\\nexamples.\\nWe see from the digits example in Figure 13.11 that hidden Markov models can\\nbe quite poor generative models for the data, because many of the synthetic digits\\nlook quite unrepresentative of the training data. If the goal is sequence classiﬁca-\\ntion, there can be signiﬁcant beneﬁt in determining the parameters of hidden Markov\\nmodels using discriminative rather than maximum likelihood techniques. Suppose\\nwe have a training set of R observation sequences Xr, where r = 1, . . . , R, each of\\nwhich is labelled according to its class m, where m = 1, . . . , M.

Hidden Markov models, coupled with\\ndiscriminative training methods, are widely used in speech recognition (Kapadia,\\n1998).\\nA signiﬁcant weakness of the hidden Markov model is the way in which it rep-\\nresents the distribution of times for which the system remains in a given state. To see\\nthe problem, note that the probability that a sequence sampled from a given hidden\\nMarkov model will spend precisely T steps in state k and then make a transition to a\\ndifferent state is given by\\np(T) = (Akk)T (1 −Akk) ∝exp (−T ln Akk)\\n(13.74)\\nand so is an exponentially decaying function of T. For many applications, this will\\nbe a very unrealistic model of state duration. The problem can be resolved by mod-\\nelling state duration directly in which the diagonal coefﬁcients Akk are all set to zero,\\nand each state k is explicitly associated with a probability distribution p(T|k) of pos-\\nsible duration times. From a generative point of view, when a state k is entered, a\\nvalue T representing the number of time steps that the system will remain in state k\\nis then drawn from p(T|k). The model then emits T values of the observed variable\\nxt, which are generally assumed to be independent so that the corresponding emis-\\nsion density is simply \\x15T\\nt=1 p(xt|k). This approach requires some straightforward\\nmodiﬁcations to the EM optimization procedure (Rabiner, 1989).\\nAnother limitation of the standard HMM is that it is poor at capturing long-\\nrange correlations between the observed variables (i.e., between variables that are\\nseparated by many time steps) because these must be mediated via the ﬁrst-order\\nMarkov chain of hidden states. Longer-range effects could in principle be included\\nby adding extra links to the graphical model of Figure 13.5. One way to address this\\nis to generalize the HMM to give the autoregressive hidden Markov model (Ephraim\\net al., 1989), an example of which is shown in Figure 13.17. For discrete observa-\\ntions, this corresponds to expanded tables of conditional probabilities for the emis-\\nsion distributions. In the case of a Gaussian emission density, we can use the linear-\\nGaussian framework in which the conditional distribution for xn given the values\\nof the previous observations, and the value of zn, is a Gaussian whose mean is a\\nlinear combination of the values of the conditioning variables. Clearly the number\\nof additional links in the graph must be limited to avoid an excessive the number of\\nfree parameters. In the example shown in Figure 13.17, each observation depends on'),\n",

Although this\\ngraph looks messy, we can again appeal to d-separation to see that in fact it still has\\na simple probabilistic structure. In particular, if we imagine conditioning on zn we\\nsee that, as with the standard HMM, the values of zn−1 and zn+1 are independent,\\ncorresponding to the conditional independence property (13.5). This is easily veri-\\nﬁed by noting that every path from node zn−1 to node zn+1 passes through at least\\none observed node that is head-to-tail with respect to that path. As a consequence,\\nwe can again use a forward-backward recursion in the E step of the EM algorithm to\\ndetermine the posterior distributions of the latent variables in a computational time\\nthat is linear in the length of the chain. Similarly, the M step involves only a minor\\nmodiﬁcation of the standard M-step equations. In the case of Gaussian emission\\ndensities this involves estimating the parameters using the standard linear regression\\nequations, discussed in Chapter 3.\\nWe have seen that the autoregressive HMM appears as a natural extension of the\\nstandard HMM when viewed as a graphical model. In fact the probabilistic graphical\\nmodelling viewpoint motivates a plethora of different graphical structures based on\\nthe HMM. Another example is the input-output hidden Markov model (Bengio and\\nFrasconi, 1995), in which we have a sequence of observed variables u1, . . . , uN, in\\naddition to the output variables x1, . . . , xN, whose values inﬂuence either the dis-\\ntribution of latent variables or output variables, or both. An example is shown in\\nFigure 13.18. This extends the HMM framework to the domain of supervised learn-\\ning for sequential data. It is again easy to show, through the use of the d-separation\\ncriterion, that the Markov property (13.5) for the chain of latent variables still holds.\\nTo verify this, simply note that there is only one path from node zn−1 to node zn+1\\nand this is head-to-tail with respect to the observed node zn. This conditional inde-\\npendence property again allows the formulation of a computationally efﬁcient learn-\\ning algorithm. In particular, we can determine the parameters θ of the model by\\nmaximizing the likelihood function L(θ) = p(X|U, θ) where U is a matrix whose\\nrows are given by uT\\nn. As a consequence of the conditional independence property\\n(13.5) this likelihood function can be maximized efﬁciently using an EM algorithm\\nin which the E step involves forward and backward recursions.\\nExercise 13.18\\nAnother variant of the HMM worthy of mention is the factorial hidden Markov\\nmodel (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997), in which there are multiple independent'),\n",

Figure 13.19 shows the corresponding graphical model.\\nThe motivation for considering factorial HMM can be seen by noting that in order to\\nrepresent, say, 10 bits of information at a given time step, a standard HMM would\\nneed K = 210 = 1024 latent states, whereas a factorial HMM could make use of 10\\nbinary latent chains. The primary disadvantage of factorial HMMs, however, lies in\\nthe additional complexity of training them. The M step for the factorial HMM model\\nis straightforward. However, observation of the x variables introduces dependencies\\nbetween the latent chains, leading to difﬁculties with the E step.

Graphical models provide a general\\ntechnique for motivating, describing, and analysing such structures, and variational\\nmethods provide a powerful framework for performing inference in those models for\\nwhich exact solution is intractable.\\n13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems\\nIn order to motivate the concept of linear dynamical systems, let us consider the\\nfollowing simple problem, which often arises in practical settings. Suppose we wish\\nto measure the value of an unknown quantity z using a noisy sensor that returns a\\nobservation x representing the value of z plus zero-mean Gaussian noise. Given a\\nsingle measurement, our best guess for z is to assume that z = x. However, we\\ncan improve our estimate for z by taking lots of measurements and averaging them,\\nbecause the random noise terms will tend to cancel each other. Now let’s make the\\nsituation more complicated by assuming that we wish to measure a quantity z that\\nis changing over time. We can take regular measurements of x so that at some point\\nin time we have obtained x1, . . . , xN and we wish to ﬁnd the corresponding values\\nz1, . . . , xN. If we simply average the measurements, the error due to random noise\\nwill be reduced, but unfortunately we will just obtain a single averaged estimate, in\\nwhich we have averaged over the changing value of z, thereby introducing a new\\nsource of error.\\nIntuitively, we could imagine doing a bit better as follows. To estimate the value\\nof zN, we take only the most recent few measurements, say xN−L, . . . , xN and just\\naverage these. If z is changing slowly, and the random noise level in the sensor is\\nhigh, it would make sense to choose a relatively long window of observations to\\naverage. Conversely, if the signal is changing quickly, and the noise levels are small,\\nwe might be better just to use xN directly as our estimate of zN. Perhaps we could\\ndo even better if we take a weighted average, in which more recent measurements'),\n",

SEQUENTIAL DATA\\nmake a greater contribution than less recent ones.\\nAlthough this sort of intuitive argument seems plausible, it does not tell us how\\nto form a weighted average, and any sort of hand-crafted weighing is hardly likely\\nto be optimal. Fortunately, we can address problems such as this much more sys-\\ntematically by deﬁning a probabilistic model that captures the time evolution and\\nmeasurement processes and then applying the inference and learning methods devel-\\noped in earlier chapters. Here we shall focus on a widely used model known as a\\nlinear dynamical system.\\nAs we have seen, the HMM corresponds to the state space model shown in\\nFigure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete but with arbitrary emission\\nprobability distributions. This graph of course describes a much broader class of\\nprobability distributions, all of which factorize according to (13.6). We now consider\\nextensions to other distributions for the latent variables. In particular, we consider\\ncontinuous latent variables in which the summations of the sum-product algorithm\\nbecome integrals. The general form of the inference algorithms will, however, be\\nthe same as for the hidden Markov model. It is interesting to note that, historically,\\nhidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems were developed independently.\\nOnce they are both expressed as graphical models, however, the deep relationship\\nbetween them immediately becomes apparent.\\nOne key requirement is that we retain an efﬁcient algorithm for inference which\\nis linear in the length of the chain. This requires that, for instance, when we take\\na quantity \\x01α(zn−1), representing the posterior probability of zn given observations\\nx1, . . . , xn, and multiply by the transition probability p(zn|zn−1) and the emission\\nprobability p(xn|zn) and then marginalize over zn−1, we obtain a distribution over\\nzn that is of the same functional form as that over \\x01α(zn−1). That is to say, the\\ndistribution must not become more complex at each stage, but must only change in\\nits parameter values. Not surprisingly, the only distributions that have this property\\nof being closed under multiplication are those belonging to the exponential family.\\nHere we consider the most important example from a practical perspective,\\nwhich is the Gaussian. In particular, we consider a linear-Gaussian state space model\\nso that the latent variables {zn}, as well as the observed variables {xn}, are multi-\\nvariate Gaussian distributions whose means are linear functions of the states of their\\nparents in the graph. We have seen that a directed graph of linear-Gaussian units\\nis equivalent to a joint Gaussian distribution over all of the variables. Furthermore,\\nmarginals such as \\x01α(zn) are also Gaussian, so that the functional form of the mes-\\nsages is preserved and we will obtain an efﬁcient inference algorithm. By contrast,\\nsuppose that the emission densities p(xn|zn) comprise a mixture of K Gaussians\\neach of which has a mean that is linear in zn. Then even if \\x01α(z1) is Gaussian, the\\nquantity \\x01α(z2) will be a mixture of K Gaussians, \\x01α(z3) will be a mixture of K2\\nGaussians, and so on, and exact inference will not be of practical value.\\nWe have seen that the hidden Markov model can be viewed as an extension of\\nthe mixture models of Chapter 9 to allow for sequential correlations in the data.\\nIn a similar way, we can view the linear dynamical system as a generalization of the\\ncontinuous latent variable models of Chapter 12 such as probabilistic PCA and factor\\nanalysis. Each pair of nodes {zn, xn} represents a linear-Gaussian latent variable'),\n",

SEQUENTIAL DATA\\n13.3.2\\nLearning in LDS\\nSo far, we have considered the inference problem for linear dynamical systems,\\nassuming that the model parameters θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0} are known. Next, we\\nconsider the determination of these parameters using maximum likelihood (Ghahra-\\nmani and Hinton, 1996b). Because the model has latent variables, this can be ad-\\ndressed using the EM algorithm, which was discussed in general terms in Chapter 9.\\nWe can derive the EM algorithm for the linear dynamical system as follows. Let\\nus denote the estimated parameter values at some particular cycle of the algorithm\\nby θold. For these parameter values, we can run the inference algorithm to determine\\nthe posterior distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, θold), or more precisely those\\nlocal posterior marginals that are required in the M step. In particular, we shall\\nrequire the following expectations\\nE [zn]\\n=\\n\\x01µn\\n(13.105)\\nE \\x08\\nznzT\\nn−1\\n\\t\\n=\\nJn−1 \\x01Vn + \\x01µn\\x01µT\\nn−1\\n(13.106)\\nE\\n\\x08\\nznzT\\nn\\n\\t\\n=\\n\\x01Vn + \\x01µn\\x01µT\\nn\\n(13.107)\\nwhere we have used (13.104).\\nNow we consider the complete-data log likelihood function, which is obtained\\nby taking the logarithm of (13.6) and is therefore given by\\nln p(X, Z|θ)\\n=\\nln p(z1|µ0, V0) +\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=2\\nln p(zn|zn−1, A, Γ)\\n+\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nln p(xn|zn, C, Σ)\\n(13.108)\\nin which we have made the dependence on the parameters explicit. We now take the\\nexpectation of the complete-data log likelihood with respect to the posterior distri-\\nbution p(Z|X, θold) which deﬁnes the function\\nQ(θ, θold) = EZ|θold [ln p(X, Z|θ)] .\\n(13.109)\\nIn the M step, this function is maximized with respect to the components of θ.\\nConsider ﬁrst the parameters µ0 and V0. If we substitute for p(z1|µ0, V0) in\\n(13.108) using (13.77), and then take the expectation with respect to Z, we obtain\\nQ(θ, θold) = −1\\n2 ln |V0| −EZ|θold\\n\\x1d1\\n2(z1 −µ0)TV−1\\n0 (z1 −µ0)\\n\\x1e\\n+ const\\nwhere all terms not dependent on µ0 or V0 have been absorbed into the additive\\nconstant.

SEQUENTIAL DATA\\nWe have approached parameter learning in the linear dynamical system using\\nmaximum likelihood. Inclusion of priors to give a MAP estimate is straightforward,\\nand a fully Bayesian treatment can be found by applying the analytical approxima-\\ntion techniques discussed in Chapter 10, though a detailed treatment is precluded\\nhere due to lack of space.\\n13.3.3\\nExtensions of LDS\\nAs with the hidden Markov model, there is considerable interest in extending\\nthe basic linear dynamical system in order to increase its capabilities. Although the\\nassumption of a linear-Gaussian model leads to efﬁcient algorithms for inference\\nand learning, it also implies that the marginal distribution of the observed variables\\nis simply a Gaussian, which represents a signiﬁcant limitation. One simple extension\\nof the linear dynamical system is to use a Gaussian mixture as the initial distribution\\nfor z1. If this mixture has K components, then the forward recursion equations\\n(13.85) will lead to a mixture of K Gaussians over each hidden variable zn, and so\\nthe model is again tractable.\\nFor many applications, the Gaussian emission density is a poor approximation.\\nIf instead we try to use a mixture of K Gaussians as the emission density, then the\\nposterior \\x01α(z1) will also be a mixture of K Gaussians. However, from (13.85) the\\nposterior \\x01α(z2) will comprise a mixture of K2 Gaussians, and so on, with \\x01α(zn)\\nbeing given by a mixture of Kn Gaussians. Thus the number of components grows\\nexponentially with the length of the chain, and so this model is impractical.\\nMore generally, introducing transition or emission models that depart from the\\nlinear-Gaussian (or other exponential family) model leads to an intractable infer-\\nence problem. We can make deterministic approximations such as assumed den-\\nsity ﬁltering or expectation propagation, or we can make use of sampling methods,\\nChapter 10\\nas discussed in Section 13.3.4. One widely used approach is to make a Gaussian\\napproximation by linearizing around the mean of the predicted distribution, which\\ngives rise to the extended Kalman ﬁlter (Zarchan and Musoff, 2005).\\nAs with hidden Markov models, we can develop interesting extensions of the ba-\\nsic linear dynamical system by expanding its graphical representation. For example,\\nthe switching state space model (Ghahramani and Hinton, 1998) can be viewed as\\na combination of the hidden Markov model with a set of linear dynamical systems.\\nThe model has multiple Markov chains of continuous linear-Gaussian latent vari-\\nables, each of which is analogous to the latent chain of the linear dynamical system\\ndiscussed earlier, together with a Markov chain of discrete variables of the form used\\nin a hidden Markov model. The output at each time step is determined by stochas-\\ntically choosing one of the continuous latent chains, using the state of the discrete\\nlatent variable as a switch, and then emitting an observation from the corresponding\\nconditional output distribution. Exact inference in this model is intractable, but vari-\\national methods lead to an efﬁcient inference scheme involving forward-backward\\nrecursions along each of the continuous and discrete Markov chains independently.\\nNote that, if we consider multiple chains of discrete latent variables, and use one as\\nthe switch to select from the remainder, we obtain an analogous model having only\\ndiscrete latent variables known as the switching hidden Markov model.'),\n",

COMBINING MODELS\\nmodel combination is to select one of the models to make the prediction, in which\\nthe choice of model is a function of the input variables. Thus different models be-\\ncome responsible for making predictions in different regions of input space. One\\nwidely used framework of this kind is known as a decision tree in which the selec-\\ntion process can be described as a sequence of binary selections corresponding to\\nthe traversal of a tree structure and is discussed in Section 14.4. In this case, the\\nindividual models are generally chosen to be very simple, and the overall ﬂexibility\\nof the model arises from the input-dependent selection process. Decision trees can\\nbe applied to both classiﬁcation and regression problems.\\nOne limitation of decision trees is that the division of input space is based on\\nhard splits in which only one model is responsible for making predictions for any\\ngiven value of the input variables. The decision process can be softened by moving\\nto a probabilistic framework for combining models, as discussed in Section 14.5. For\\nexample, if we have a set of K models for a conditional distribution p(t|x, k) where\\nx is the input variable, t is the target variable, and k = 1, . . . , K indexes the model,\\nthen we can form a probabilistic mixture of the form\\np(t|x) =\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nπk(x)p(t|x, k)\\n(14.1)\\nin which πk(x) = p(k|x) represent the input-dependent mixing coefﬁcients. Such\\nmodels can be viewed as mixture distributions in which the component densities, as\\nwell as the mixing coefﬁcients, are conditioned on the input variables and are known\\nas mixtures of experts. They are closely related to the mixture density network model\\ndiscussed in Section 5.6.\\n14.1. Bayesian Model Averaging\\nIt is important to distinguish between model combination methods and Bayesian\\nmodel averaging, as the two are often confused. To understand the difference, con-\\nsider the example of density estimation using a mixture of Gaussians in which several\\nSection 9.2\\nGaussian components are combined probabilistically. The model contains a binary\\nlatent variable z that indicates which component of the mixture is responsible for\\ngenerating the corresponding data point. Thus the model is speciﬁed in terms of a\\njoint distribution\\np(x, z)\\n(14.2)\\nand the corresponding density over the observed variable x is obtained by marginal-\\nizing over the latent variable\\np(x) =\\n\\x02\\nz\\np(x, z).\\n(14.3)'),\n",

By contrast, when we combine multiple models, as in (14.5), we\\nsee that different data points within the data set can potentially be generated from\\ndifferent values of the latent variable z and hence by different components.\\nAlthough we have considered the marginal probability p(X), the same consid-\\nerations apply for the predictive density p(x|X) or for conditional distributions such\\nas p(t|x, X, T).\\nExercise 14.1\\n14.2.

Boosting can give good results even if the base classiﬁers have a\\nperformance that is only slightly better than random, and hence sometimes the base\\nclassiﬁers are known as weak learners. Originally designed for solving classiﬁcation\\nproblems, boosting can also be extended to regression (Friedman, 2001).\\nThe principal difference between boosting and the committee methods such as\\nbagging discussed above, is that the base classiﬁers are trained in sequence, and\\neach base classiﬁer is trained using a weighted form of the data set in which the\\nweighting coefﬁcient associated with each data point depends on the performance\\nof the previous classiﬁers. In particular, points that are misclassiﬁed by one of the\\nbase classiﬁers are given greater weight when used to train the next classiﬁer in\\nthe sequence. Once all the classiﬁers have been trained, their predictions are then\\ncombined through a weighted majority voting scheme, as illustrated schematically\\nin Figure 14.1.\\nConsider a two-class classiﬁcation problem, in which the training data comprises\\ninput vectors x1, . . . , xN along with corresponding binary target variables t1, . . . , tN\\nwhere tn ∈{−1, 1}. Each data point is given an associated weighting parameter\\nwn, which is initially set 1/N for all data points. We shall suppose that we have\\na procedure available for training a base classiﬁer using weighted data to give a\\nfunction y(x) ∈{−1, 1}. At each stage of the algorithm, AdaBoost trains a new\\nclassiﬁer using a data set in which the weighting coefﬁcients are adjusted according\\nto the performance of the previously trained classiﬁer so as to give greater weight\\nto the misclassiﬁed data points. Finally, when the desired number of base classiﬁers\\nhave been trained, they are combined to form a committee using coefﬁcients that\\ngive different weight to different base classiﬁers. The precise form of the AdaBoost\\nalgorithm is given below.'),\n",

This result motivates the use of the sign\\nfunction in (14.19) to arrive at the ﬁnal classiﬁcation decision.\\nWe have already seen that the minimizer y(x) of the cross-entropy error (4.90)\\nfor two-class classiﬁcation is given by the posterior class probability. In the case\\nof a target variable t ∈{−1, 1}, we have seen that the error function is given by\\nSection 7.1.2\\nln(1 + exp(−yt)). This is compared with the exponential error function in Fig-\\nure 14.3, where we have divided the cross-entropy error by a constant factor ln(2)\\nso that it passes through the point (0, 1) for ease of comparison. We see that both\\ncan be seen as continuous approximations to the ideal misclassiﬁcation error func-\\ntion. An advantage of the exponential error is that its sequential minimization leads\\nto the simple AdaBoost scheme. One drawback, however, is that it penalizes large\\nnegative values of ty(x) much more strongly than cross-entropy. In particular, we\\nsee that for large negative values of ty, the cross-entropy grows linearly with |ty|,\\nwhereas the exponential error function grows exponentially with |ty|. Thus the ex-\\nponential error function will be much less robust to outliers or misclassiﬁed data\\npoints. Another important difference between cross-entropy and the exponential er-\\nror function is that the latter cannot be interpreted as the log likelihood function of\\nany well-deﬁned probabilistic model. Furthermore, the exponential error does not\\nExercise 14.8\\ngeneralize to classiﬁcation problems having K > 2 classes, again in contrast to the\\ncross-entropy for a probabilistic model, which is easily generalized to give (4.108).\\nSection 4.3.4\\nThe interpretation of boosting as the sequential optimization of an additive model\\nunder an exponential error (Friedman et al., 2000) opens the door to a wide range\\nof boosting-like algorithms, including multiclass extensions, by altering the choice\\nof error function. It also motivates the extension to regression problems (Friedman,\\n2001). If we consider a sum-of-squares error function for regression, then sequential\\nminimization of an additive model of the form (14.21) simply involves ﬁtting each\\nnew base classiﬁer to the residual errors tn−fm−1(xn) from the previous model.

The recursive subdivision can be described by the traversal\\nof the binary tree shown in Figure 14.6. For any new input x, we determine which\\nregion it falls into by starting at the top of the tree at the root node and following\\na path down to a speciﬁc leaf node according to the decision criteria at each node.\\nNote that such decision trees are not probabilistic graphical models.\\nWithin each region, there is a separate model to predict the target variable. For\\ninstance, in regression we might simply predict a constant over each region, or in\\nclassiﬁcation we might assign each region to a speciﬁc class. A key property of tree-\\nbased models, which makes them popular in ﬁelds such as medical diagnosis, for\\nexample, is that they are readily interpretable by humans because they correspond\\nto a sequence of binary decisions applied to the individual input variables. For in-\\nstance, to predict a patient’s disease, we might ﬁrst ask “is their temperature greater\\nthan some threshold?”.

Tree-based Models\\n665\\nolds) to minimize the sum-of-squares error is usually computationally infeasible due\\nto the combinatorially large number of possible solutions. Instead, a greedy opti-\\nmization is generally done by starting with a single root node, corresponding to the\\nwhole input space, and then growing the tree by adding nodes one at a time. At each\\nstep there will be some number of candidate regions in input space that can be split,\\ncorresponding to the addition of a pair of leaf nodes to the existing tree. For each\\nof these, there is a choice of which of the D input variables to split, as well as the\\nvalue of the threshold. The joint optimization of the choice of region to split, and the\\nchoice of input variable and threshold, can be done efﬁciently by exhaustive search\\nnoting that, for a given choice of split variable and threshold, the optimal choice of\\npredictive variable is given by the local average of the data, as noted earlier. This\\nis repeated for all possible choices of variable to be split, and the one that gives the\\nsmallest residual sum-of-squares error is retained.\\nGiven a greedy strategy for growing the tree, there remains the issue of when\\nto stop adding nodes. A simple approach would be to stop when the reduction in\\nresidual error falls below some threshold. However, it is found empirically that often\\nnone of the available splits produces a signiﬁcant reduction in error, and yet after\\nseveral more splits a substantial error reduction is found. For this reason, it is com-\\nmon practice to grow a large tree, using a stopping criterion based on the number\\nof data points associated with the leaf nodes, and then prune back the resulting tree.\\nThe pruning is based on a criterion that balances residual error against a measure of\\nmodel complexity. If we denote the starting tree for pruning by T0, then we deﬁne\\nT ⊂T0 to be a subtree of T0 if it can be obtained by pruning nodes from T0 (in\\nother words, by collapsing internal nodes by combining the corresponding regions).\\nSuppose the leaf nodes are indexed by τ = 1, . . . , |T|, with leaf node τ representing\\na region Rτ of input space having Nτ data points, and |T| denoting the total number\\nof leaf nodes. The optimal prediction for region Rτ is then given by\\nyτ = 1\\nNτ\\n\\x02\\nxn∈Rτ\\ntn\\n(14.29)\\nand the corresponding contribution to the residual sum-of-squares is then\\nQτ(T) =\\n\\x02\\nxn∈Rτ\\n{tn −yτ}2 .\\n(14.30)\\nThe pruning criterion is then given by\\nC(T) =\\n|T |\\n\\x02\\nτ=1\\nQτ(T) + λ|T|\\n(14.31)\\nThe regularization parameter λ determines the trade-off between the overall residual\\nsum-of-squares error and the complexity of the model as measured by the number\\n|T| of leaf nodes, and its value is chosen by cross-validation.\\nFor classiﬁcation problems, the process of growing and pruning the tree is sim-\\nilar, except that the sum-of-squares error is replaced by a more appropriate measure'),\n",

If we deﬁne pτk to be the proportion of data points in region Rτ\\nassigned to class k, where k = 1, . . . , K, then two commonly used choices are the\\ncross-entropy\\nQτ(T) =\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\npτk ln pτk\\n(14.32)\\nand the Gini index\\nQτ(T) =\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\npτk (1 −pτk) .\\n(14.33)\\nThese both vanish for pτk = 0 and pτk = 1 and have a maximum at pτk = 0.5. They\\nencourage the formation of regions in which a high proportion of the data points are\\nassigned to one class. The cross entropy and the Gini index are better measures than\\nthe misclassiﬁcation rate for growing the tree because they are more sensitive to the\\nnode probabilities. Also, unlike misclassiﬁcation rate, they are differentiable and\\nExercise 14.11\\nhence better suited to gradient based optimization methods. For subsequent pruning\\nof the tree, the misclassiﬁcation rate is generally used.\\nThe human interpretability of a tree model such as CART is often seen as its\\nmajor strength. However, in practice it is found that the particular tree structure that\\nis learned is very sensitive to the details of the data set, so that a small change to the\\ntraining data can result in a very different set of splits (Hastie et al., 2001).\\nThere are other problems with tree-based methods of the kind considered in\\nthis section. One is that the splits are aligned with the axes of the feature space,\\nwhich may be very suboptimal. For instance, to separate two classes whose optimal\\ndecision boundary runs at 45 degrees to the axes would need a large number of\\naxis-parallel splits of the input space as compared to a single non-axis-aligned split.\\nFurthermore, the splits in a decision tree are hard, so that each region of input space\\nis associated with one, and only one, leaf node model. The last issue is particularly\\nproblematic in regression where we are typically aiming to model smooth functions,\\nand yet the tree model produces piecewise-constant predictions with discontinuities\\nat the split boundaries.\\n14.5. Conditional Mixture Models\\nWe have seen that standard decision trees are restricted by hard, axis-aligned splits of\\nthe input space. These constraints can be relaxed, at the expense of interpretability,\\nby allowing soft, probabilistic splits that can be functions of all of the input variables,\\nnot just one of them at a time. If we also give the leaf models a probabilistic inter-\\npretation, we arrive at a fully probabilistic tree-based model called the hierarchical\\nmixture of experts, which we consider in Section 14.5.3.\\nAn alternative way to motivate the hierarchical mixture of experts model is to\\nstart with a standard probabilistic mixtures of unconditional density models such as\\nGaussians and replace the component densities with conditional distributions. Here\\nChapter 9\\nwe consider mixtures of linear regression models (Section 14.5.1) and mixtures of'),\n",

This can be done, for instance, by viewing the conditional\\ndistribution representing the linear regression model as a node in a directed prob-\\nabilistic graph. Here we consider a simple example corresponding to a mixture of\\nlinear regression models, which represents a straightforward extension of the Gaus-\\nsian mixture model discussed in Section 9.2 to the case of conditional Gaussian\\ndistributions.\\nWe therefore consider K linear regression models, each governed by its own\\nweight parameter wk. In many applications, it will be appropriate to use a common\\nnoise variance, governed by a precision parameter β, for all K components, and this\\nis the case we consider here. We will once again restrict attention to a single target\\nvariable t, though the extension to multiple outputs is straightforward. If we denote\\nExercise 14.12\\nthe mixing coefﬁcients by πk, then the mixture distribution can be written\\np(t|θ) =\\nK\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nπkN(t|wT\\nk φ, β−1)\\n(14.34)\\nwhere θ denotes the set of all adaptive parameters in the model, namely W = {wk},\\nπ = {πk}, and β. The log likelihood function for this model, given a data set of\\nobservations {φn, tn}, then takes the form\\nln p(t|θ) =\\nN\\n\\x02\\nn=1\\nln\\n\\x16 K\\n\\x02\\nk=1\\nπkN(tn|wT\\nk φn, β−1)\\n\\x17\\n(14.35)\\nwhere t = (t1, . . . , tN)T denotes the vector of target variables.\\nIn order to maximize this likelihood function, we can once again appeal to the\\nEM algorithm, which will turn out to be a simple extension of the EM algorithm for\\nunconditional Gaussian mixtures of Section 9.2. We can therefore build on our expe-\\nrience with the unconditional mixture and introduce a set Z = {zn} of binary latent\\nvariables where znk ∈{0, 1} in which, for each data point n, all of the elements\\nk = 1, . . . , K are zero except for a single value of 1 indicating which component\\nof the mixture was responsible for generating that data point.

DATA SETS\\nFigure A.1\\nOne hundred examples of the\\nMNIST digits chosen at ran-\\ndom from the training set.\\nOil Flow\\nThis is a synthetic data set that arose out of a project aimed at measuring nonin-\\nvasively the proportions of oil, water, and gas in North Sea oil transfer pipelines\\n(Bishop and James, 1993). It is based on the principle of dual-energy gamma densit-\\nometry. The ideas is that if a narrow beam of gamma rays is passed through the pipe,\\nthe attenuation in the intensity of the beam provides information about the density of\\nmaterial along its path. Thus, for instance, the beam will be attenuated more strongly\\nby oil than by gas.\\nA single attenuation measurement alone is not sufﬁcient because there are two\\ndegrees of freedom corresponding to the fraction of oil and the fraction of water (the\\nfraction of gas is redundant because the three fractions must add to one). To address\\nthis, two gamma beams of different energies (in other words different frequencies or\\nwavelengths) are passed through the pipe along the same path, and the attenuation of\\neach is measured. Because the absorbtion properties of different materials vary dif-\\nferently as a function of energy, measurement of the attenuations at the two energies\\nprovides two independent pieces of information. Given the known absorbtion prop-\\nerties of oil, water, and gas at the two energies, it is then a simple matter to calculate\\nthe average fractions of oil and water (and hence of gas) measured along the path of\\nthe gamma beams.\\nThere is a further complication, however, associated with the motion of the ma-\\nterials along the pipe. If the ﬂow velocity is small, then the oil ﬂoats on top of the\\nwater with the gas sitting above the oil. This is known as a laminar or stratiﬁed'),\n",

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS\\n693\\nVon Mises\\nThe von Mises distribution, also known as the circular normal or the circular Gaus-\\nsian, is a univariate Gaussian-like periodic distribution for a variable θ ∈[0, 2π).\\np(θ|θ0, m)\\n=\\n1\\n2πI0(m) exp {m cos(θ −θ0)}\\n(B.77)\\nwhere I0(m) is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind.

Care must be taken in interpret-\\ning this distribution because simple expectations will be dependent on the (arbitrary)\\nchoice of origin for the variable θ. The parameter θ0 is analogous to the mean of a\\nunivariate Gaussian, and the parameter m > 0, known as the concentration param-\\neter, is analogous to the precision (inverse variance).

In all cases, we\\nassume that inverses exist and that matrix dimensions are such that the formulae\\nare correctly deﬁned.

Calculus of Variations\\nWe can think of a function y(x) as being an operator that, for any input value x,\\nreturns an output value y. In the same way, we can deﬁne a functional F[y] to be\\nan operator that takes a function y(x) and returns an output value F. An example of\\na functional is the length of a curve drawn in a two-dimensional plane in which the\\npath of the curve is deﬁned in terms of a function. In the context of machine learning,\\na widely used functional is the entropy H[x] for a continuous variable x because, for\\nany choice of probability density function p(x), it returns a scalar value representing\\nthe entropy of x under that density. Thus the entropy of p(x) could equally well have\\nbeen written as H[p].\\nA common problem in conventional calculus is to ﬁnd a value of x that max-\\nimizes (or minimizes) a function y(x). Similarly, in the calculus of variations we\\nseek a function y(x) that maximizes (or minimizes) a functional F[y]. That is, of all\\npossible functions y(x), we wish to ﬁnd the particular function for which the func-\\ntional F[y] is a maximum (or minimum).

Requiring that the\\nfunctional be stationary with respect to small variations in the function y(x) gives\\n\\x06\\nδE\\nδy(x)η(x) dx = 0.\\n(D.4)\\nBecause this must hold for an arbitrary choice of η(x), it follows that the functional\\nderivative must vanish. To see this, imagine choosing a perturbation η(x) that is zero\\neverywhere except in the neighbourhood of a point \\x01x, in which case the functional\\nderivative must be zero at x = \\x01x. However, because this must be true for every\\nchoice of \\x01x, the functional derivative must vanish for all values of x.\\nConsider a functional that is deﬁned by an integral over a function G(y, y′, x)\\nthat depends on both y(x) and its derivative y′(x) as well as having a direct depen-\\ndence on x\\nF[y] =\\n\\x06\\nG (y(x), y′(x), x) dx\\n(D.5)\\nwhere the value of y(x) is assumed to be ﬁxed at the boundary of the region of\\nintegration (which might be at inﬁnity).

Lagrange Multipliers\\nLagrange multipliers, also sometimes called undetermined multipliers, are used to\\nﬁnd the stationary points of a function of several variables subject to one or more\\nconstraints.\\nConsider the problem of ﬁnding the maximum of a function f(x1, x2) subject to\\na constraint relating x1 and x2, which we write in the form\\ng(x1, x2) = 0.\\n(E.1)\\nOne approach would be to solve the constraint equation (E.1) and thus express x2 as\\na function of x1 in the form x2 = h(x1). This can then be substituted into f(x1, x2)\\nto give a function of x1 alone of the form f(x1, h(x1)). The maximum with respect\\nto x1 could then be found by differentiation in the usual way, to give the stationary\\nvalue x⋆\\n1, with the corresponding value of x2 given by x⋆\\n2 = h(x⋆\\n1).\\nOne problem with this approach is that it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd an analytic\\nsolution of the constraint equation that allows x2 to be expressed as an explicit func-\\ntion of x1. Also, this approach treats x1 and x2 differently and so spoils the natural\\nsymmetry between these variables.\\nA more elegant, and often simpler, approach is based on the introduction of a\\nparameter λ called a Lagrange multiplier. We shall motivate this technique from\\na geometrical perspective. Consider a D-dimensional variable x with components\\nx1, . . . , xD.

Thus ∇f\\nand ∇g are parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors, and so there must exist a parameter λ\\nsuch that\\n∇f + λ∇g = 0\\n(E.3)\\nwhere λ ̸= 0 is known as a Lagrange multiplier. Note that λ can have either sign.\\nAt this point, it is convenient to introduce the Lagrangian function deﬁned by\\nL(x, λ) ≡f(x) + λg(x).\\n(E.4)\\nThe constrained stationarity condition (E.3) is obtained by setting ∇xL = 0. Fur-\\nthermore, the condition ∂L/∂λ = 0 leads to the constraint equation g(x) = 0.\\nThus to ﬁnd the maximum of a function f(x) subject to the constraint g(x) = 0,\\nwe deﬁne the Lagrangian function given by (E.4) and we then ﬁnd the stationary\\npoint of L(x, λ) with respect to both x and λ. For a D-dimensional vector x, this\\ngives D +1 equations that determine both the stationary point x⋆and the value of λ.\\nIf we are only interested in x⋆, then we can eliminate λ from the stationarity equa-\\ntions without needing to ﬁnd its value (hence the term ‘undetermined multiplier’).\\nAs a simple example, suppose we wish to ﬁnd the stationary point of the function\\nf(x1, x2) = 1 −x2\\n1 −x2\\n2 subject to the constraint g(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 −1 = 0, as\\nillustrated in Figure E.2.

In the former case, the function g(x) plays no role\\nand so the stationary condition is simply ∇f(x) = 0.

Now, however, the sign of the Lagrange multiplier is\\ncrucial, because the function f(x) will only be at a maximum if its gradient is ori-\\nented away from the region g(x) > 0, as illustrated in Figure E.3.
